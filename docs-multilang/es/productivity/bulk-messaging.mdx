## Overview

Bulk Messaging (Broadcast) lets you send the same message to multiple contacts simultaneously. Unlike WhatsApp's native broadcast feature, Eazybe's bulk messaging integrates with your labels and quick replies for targeted, personalized outreach.

<Warning>
**Important:** Use this feature responsibly and in limited manner. Excessive bulk messaging may violate WhatsApp's terms of service and could result in your number being banned. Always read the disclaimer before sending.
</Warning>

## Targeting with Labels

Labels help you segment your contacts for targeted messaging:

| Label | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| **Hot Leads** | Send promotional offers |
| **New Customers** | Send onboarding messages |
| **Pending Payment** | Send payment reminders |
| **Support** | Send resolution updates |

## Extension vs WABA Broadcasting

| Feature | Extension Broadcast | WABA Broadcast |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Volume** | Limited (use carefully) | Thousands of messages |
| **Requires laptop** | Yes | No (cloud-based) |
| **Templates** | Quick Replies | Meta-approved templates |
| **Risk** | Higher (personal number) | Lower (official API) |
| **Best for** | Small batches, existing contacts | Large-scale campaigns |

<Info>
For high-volume broadcasting without risking your personal number, consider using [WABA Broadcasting](/waba/broadcasting/overview) which uses Meta's official API.
