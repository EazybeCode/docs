## After Disconnection

Once you disconnect the HubSpot integration:

- The **HubSpot icon** will disappear from the extension's right sidebar
- All synced data will remain in both systems, but new syncing will stop
- You can reconnect at any time by following the [Account Connection guide](/en/integrations/hubspot/account-connection)

<Warning>
Disconnecting HubSpot will stop all automatic syncing between WhatsApp and HubSpot. Make sure you've completed any important tasks before disconnecting.
</Warning>
