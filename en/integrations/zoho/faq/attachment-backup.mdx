## Where Attachments Are Stored

Attachments are stored in two sections within Zoho Leads and Contacts pages:

### Notes Section

A link is generated for each attachment, allowing easy access to the file directly from the notes.

Files are organized in a tabular format displaying:
- File Name
- Attached By
- Date Added
- Size
