## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Number not eligible for connection">
    This usually means:
    - The number lacks sufficient activity (use it actively for 7-30 days)
    - It was recently disconnected from another provider (wait 1-2 months)
    - It's a personal WhatsApp number (must be Business App)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't find 'Connect to Business Platform' message">
    Ensure your WhatsApp Business App is version **2.24.17 or higher**. Update from your app store if needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Chat history not syncing">
    Keep your WhatsApp Business App open during the sync process. Ensure stable internet connection on both phone and computer.
