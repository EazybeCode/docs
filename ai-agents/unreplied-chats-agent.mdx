## Overview

The Unreplied Chats AI Agent automatically monitors your team's WhatsApp conversations, identifies which ones need immediate attention, and alerts your team based on urgency.

## How It Works

### Automatic Chat Categorization

The AI agent scans every unreplied chat and applies a priority label based on:

- **Keywords**: urgent, cancel, refund, help, ASAP, complaint
- **Customer Value**: High-value customers from your CRM
- **Time Sensitivity**: How long the message has been waiting
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detecting frustration or urgency in tone

### Scheduled Admin Notifications

Designated administrators receive WhatsApp message summaries every 3 hours listing unreplied chats, grouped by criticality.

## Priority Levels

| Level | Visual | Triggers |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Red badge | Complaints, cancellations, urgent requests |
| 🟡 **Important** | Yellow badge | Questions, follow-ups, buying signals |
| 🟢 **Normal** | Green badge | General inquiries, informational |
