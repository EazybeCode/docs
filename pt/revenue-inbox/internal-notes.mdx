## Internal Notes

Add internal notes to conversations that are only visible to your team.

### What Are Internal Notes?

Internal notes are:
- **Private** - Not sent to the customer
- **Team visible** - All team members can see them
- **Persistent** - Saved with the conversation
- **Contextual** - Help with handoffs

### Use Cases

| Use Case | Example Note |
