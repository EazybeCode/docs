## Overview

Human handoff ensures customers can always reach a real person when the chatbot can't help.

## When to Handoff

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Customer Request" icon="hand">
    Customer explicitly asks for human
  </Card>
  <Card title="Complex Query" icon="question">
    Bot can't understand or handle
  </Card>
  <Card title="High Value" icon="star">
    VIP customer or large deal
  </Card>
  <Card title="Negative Sentiment" icon="face-frown">
    Customer is frustrated
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Configuring Handoff

### Basic Handoff

Simply end the bot flow and notify team:

1. Add **Handoff Node** to flow
2. Set notification message
3. Choose assignment rule

### Smart Routing

Route to specific team members based on:

| Rule | Routes To |
|------|-----------|
| Topic: Sales | Sales team |
| Topic: Support | Support team |
| Language: Spanish | Spanish-speaking agents |
| VIP Customer | Account manager |

## Handoff Message

What the customer sees:

```
Thanks for your patience! I'm connecting you with a team member who can help better.

One of our team will respond shortly.
Average response time: 5 minutes
```

## Team Notification

What the team sees:

```
🔔 Handoff from Bot

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Always confirm the handoff with the customer so they know to wait for a human response.
</Tip>

### Do's ✅
- Set clear expectations on wait time
- Provide context to the human agent
- Allow customers to request handoff anytime
- Send confirmation of handoff

### Don'ts ❌
- Leave customer hanging without confirmation
- Lose conversation context
- Make handoff hard to find
- Route to unavailable agents
