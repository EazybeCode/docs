Yes, EazyBe supports attachments backup. When syncing WhatsApp conversations with ZOHO, the following types of attachments are backed up:


- **Images**: Photos and screenshots shared in chats.


- **Documents**: Files such as PDFs, Word documents, and spreadsheets.


- **Audio Files**: Voice messages and other audio recordings.


- **Videos**: Video clips shared in conversations.


- **Other Files**: Any other types of files that may be shared in WhatsApp chats.


Attachments from WhatsApp conversations are stored in both the **Notes** and **Attachments** sections of the Zoho Leads and Contacts pages.


**In the Notes section:** A link is generated for each attachment, allowing easy access to the file. The link is displayed along with the respective chat, making it accessible directly from the conversation context.
