An official WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) unlocks powerful features for your business to communicate with customers at scale. This guide explains what a WABA is and what you need before you connect it to Eazybe.

## What is a WABA?

When you connect to Eazybe by scanning a QR code, you are using your personal or a standard WhatsApp Business number. A WABA is different — it's an official business line connected directly to Meta's servers.

<Info>
A WABA provides enterprise-grade messaging capabilities, allowing you to send broadcasts at scale without the risk of being blocked.

| **Connection** | WhatsApp must stay on and connected | No mobile phone required |
| **Broadcasts** | Limited & risk of blocking | Send to thousands of users safely |
| **Credibility** | Standard profile | Official business profile, eligible for Green Tick |
| **Team Access** | One user at a time | Multiple team members in one Team Inbox |
| **Use Case** | Low-volume, personal chats | Marketing, notifications, and support at scale |
