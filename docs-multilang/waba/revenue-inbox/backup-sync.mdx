## Chrome Extension Backup

### Setting Up Backup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open WhatsApp Web">
    Ensure you have the Eazybe Chrome extension installed and WhatsApp Web open
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Backup & Sync">
    In the Eazybe sidebar, click the **Backup and Sync** button
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Labels">
    Choose which labels to sync:
    - **All Labels** - Backup everything
    - **Specific Labels** - Only sync selected labels (e.g., "Hot Leads", "VIP Customers")
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Settings">
    Click **Save** to start syncing
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View in Team Inbox">
    Click **View chats in Team Inbox** to see synced conversations
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Label-Based Sync Control

You can control sync at the label level:

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Sync** | Chats with this label are backed up to Team Inbox |
| **Don't Sync** | Chats with this label are excluded from backup |

<Tip>
Create a label called "No Backup" and add it to personal chats you don't want synced to the team inbox.
</Tip>

### Where Is Data Stored?

<Info>
**Privacy First:** Eazybe does not store chat data on its servers. All backup data is stored in your organization admin's **Google Drive**, ensuring you maintain full control of your data.
</Info>

## WABA API Sync

For WhatsApp Business API users, sync is **automatic**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect WABA">
    Complete WABA setup via [Connect WABA](/waba/connect-waba)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Sync">
    All incoming and outgoing messages automatically appear in Team Inbox
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="No Extension Needed">
    WABA sync works 24/7 without requiring WhatsApp Web or laptop
  </Step>
</Steps>

### WABA vs Extension Backup

| Feature | Chrome Extension | WABA API |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| **Requires laptop open** | Yes | No |
| **24/7 sync** | Only when active | Yes |
| **Selective by label** | Yes | All conversations |
| **Works with personal WA** | Yes | No (Business only) |
| **Best for** | Small teams, QR users | Growing teams, API users |

## CRM Integration Sync

If you've connected a CRM (HubSpot, Zoho, etc.), chats also sync to your CRM:

- **Contacts** - Chat history attached to CRM contact
- **Deals** - Conversations linked to active deals
- **Companies** - Chats visible at company level

### Check Sync Status

Admins can verify sync status for all team members:

1. Go to **Workspace** → **Dashboard**
2. View the **Last Chat Synced** column
3. Identify any team members with stale sync times

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Chats not syncing">
    - Ensure WhatsApp Web is open with extension active
    - Check that the label is set to "Sync" not "Don't Sync"
    - Verify internet connection is stable
    - Try clicking "Backup & Sync" again
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing old chats">
    Extension backup only syncs **new messages** after setup. For historical chats, use the initial backup feature.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Sync taking too long">
    Large chat volumes may take time. Leave WhatsApp Web open and let it complete.
