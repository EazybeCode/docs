## Scheduler API

For developers, Eazybe offers a Scheduler API to programmatically schedule messages:

```javascript
POST https://api.eazybe.com/v2/scheduler/public-scheduler

{
  "from": "your-email@company.com",
  "to": "919876543210",
  "message": "Hello World",
  "name": "Contact Name",
  "time": "2024-03-01T17:25:00.000Z"
}
```

<Warning>
Use the Scheduler API responsibly. Avoid spam or bulk messaging that could result in your number being banned by WhatsApp.
</Warning>
