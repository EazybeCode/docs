### **1. Why is business verification required**
Meta uses **Business Verification** to confirm that your company is a real, legally registered business. 
A verified business can unlock higher WhatsApp messaging limits, add more phone numbers, and is required by many WhatsApp Business Solution Providers (BSPs) to enable large-scale broadcasting.


### **2. Prerequisites checklist**
Before you start, make sure you have the following:
- **Admin access** to your Meta Business (Business Manager) account in Meta Business Suite.


- A **legal, registered business** (company, LLP, sole proprietorship, etc.).


- A **website** that shows your legal business name in the footer, About, or Contact section.


- Access to a **business email or phone number** that matches your business information.


You will also need clear scans or PDFs of at least 2–3 official documents:
- Business registration certificate/incorporation certificate / GST or tax certificate.


- Utility bill, bank statement, or phone bill showing your business address or phone.


- Screenshot to include in your document: “Sample acceptable business documents list” (e.g., certificate + utility bill).


### **3. Accessing Meta Business Suite & Security Centre**

- Open a browser and go to business.facebook.com, then log in with your Facebook account.
- Select the **correct Business** from the dropdown in the top-left (the same one connected to your WhatsApp setup / BSP).


- In the left sidebar, click **Settings** → **Business settings** (or “More Business settings”, depending on your layout).


- In Business settings, go to **Security Centre** in the left or top navigation.


In Security Centre, you will either see **Start verification** or a note saying you are ineligible for verification at this time.

### **4. Starting the verification process**

- In **Security Centre**, click **Start verification**.


- A wizard will open, asking for your **business details** such as:


- Legal business name (must match your official documents).


- Business address (city, state, postal code exactly as on documents).


- Business phone number (can be any business number where Meta can reach you, not necessarily the WhatsApp number).


- Website URL where your legal name is clearly visible.


3. Carefully review the information and click **Next / Continue**.

### **5. Uploading your business documents**
On the documents step, Meta will ask you to upload files that prove:
- Your **legal business name** (registration certificate, GST/tax cert, incorporation document).


- Your **business address** (same or another document showing address).


- Optionally, your **business phone number** (phone/utility bill, bank statement, etc.).


Guidelines to follow:
- Upload **clear, readable** scans or PDFs; avoid cropped or blurred images.
- Ensure the **name and address exactly match** what you typed in the form.


- Use official government or tax-related documents wherever possible.

Click **Submit / Next** once all required files are uploaded.


### **6. Confirming your business via email, phone, or domain**
After submitting documents, Meta asks you to confirm your connection to the business using one of these methods (options depend on your setup and region):


**Email verification**


- Meta sends a code to a **work email** (for example, [name@yourcompany.com](mailto:name@yourcompany.com)).


- The email domain must match your website domain.


**Phone/text verification**


- Meta calls or sends an SMS with a code to your business phone number.


- You may be asked to upload a document (e.g., utility bill) that shows this phone number.


**Domain verification**


- You add a DNS TXT record or upload a special HTML file to your website domain following Meta’s instructions.


- Once Meta detects it, your domain is verified and linked to your business.


Enter the code you receive or complete domain setup, then click **Verify / Continue** in Meta.

### **7. Checking status and typical review time**
**After completion, your request goes into review with Meta.**


- For many accounts, decisions may arrive within **a few minutes to 1–2 business days**, but it can also take up to **10–14 business days** in some cases.


- You can check progress in **Business settings → Security Center**, where the status will show as **In review**, **Business verified**, or **Verification failed**.


When verification is approved, you will see a green shield and the label **Business verified** next to your business name.

### **8. Common rejection reasons (and how to avoid them)**
**If Meta rejects your verification, it is usually due to one of the following:**


- The **business name or address** in the form does not exactly match your documents.


- Uploaded files are **unclear, cropped, or missing pages**.


- The business website does **not show the legal business name** clearly.


- An unsupported or incorrect document type (e.g., personal ID instead of business registration).


Meta typically allows multiple attempts; if verification fails several times, you may need to **appeal** or contact Meta support via their help channels.

### **9. After verification: enabling WhatsApp broadcasting**
**Once your Meta Business shows as Business verified, your WhatsApp BSP / platform (e.g., your broadcasting tool) can:**


- Unlock higher **messaging limits** so you can send campaigns to more contacts.


- Add more WhatsApp numbers under the same Business Manager if needed.


- Proceed with any remaining setup for **WhatsApp Business API/Cloud API** and broadcasting templates.


Recommendation for your documentation: add a final step like “Once you see ‘Business verified’, please share a screenshot with our support team so we can complete your WhatsApp broadcasting setup.”


### **10. Quick reference block **

- Where to go: **[business.facebook.com](http://business.facebook.com) → Business settings → Security Centre → Start verification**.


- What you need: Admin access, correct business details, website, and 2–3 official documents.


- Typical review time: From a few minutes up to 10–14 business days.


- Success indicator: Green shield + **Business verified** status in Security Centre.
