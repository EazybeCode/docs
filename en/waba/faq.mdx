## CSV & Contact Upload

    - File format must be `.csv`
    - Must contain a column labeled **"Phone"**
    - Phone numbers must include country codes
    - Do **NOT** include the "+" symbol

    ```
    Phone
    91xxxxxxxxxx

## WABA Coexistence

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why did my WABA Coexistence account disconnect?" icon="link-slash">
    WABA Coexistence allows you to use both the WhatsApp mobile app and WABA simultaneously. However, certain actions can cause disconnection:

    **Common disconnection triggers:**

    1. **Device switching** - Moving to a new mobile device without proper migration
    2. **Simultaneous sessions** - Using the mobile app and WhatsApp Web at the same time
    3. **Extended inactivity** - No activity for more than 14 days
    4. **Spam violations** - Sending bulk unsolicited messages that violate WhatsApp Business Policy
    5. **App switching** - Moving your number between consumer WhatsApp and Business app

    <Warning>
    To maintain coexistence, avoid these triggers and ensure regular activity on your account.
