### To ensure workflow messages are scheduled successfully, the **Email ID registered on your HubSpot account and your Eazybe account must be the same**.


#### **Steps to ensure:**

- Install Eazybe Chrome extension from the official store.


- Integrate with HubSpot via Eazybe by following the in-app prompts and granting permissions.


- Check for successful linkage by seeing Eazybe-enabled features in HubSpot.

#### **Steps to ensure:**

- Log in to your HubSpot account and note your registered email.


- Open Eazybe, go to Account Settings, and verify registered email matches HubSpot.


- If needed, update your email in HubSpot or Eazybe so they are identical before setting up workflows.

### However, to ensure workflow messages are sent successfully when WhatsApp Web is not open, your **cloud connection must be active**.


#### **Steps to ensure: **

- The cloud should be connected for workflows to get sent successfully when WhatsApp Web is not active.

### Workflow messages are always sent from the contact owner’s or the deal owner’s WhatsApp number regardless of which user created the workflow.


#### **Steps to ensure: **

- Assign the correct owner to each contact or deal in HubSpot.


- Confirm the owner’s WhatsApp number is integrated via Eazybe.


- When adding a WhatsApp action in a workflow, the sender will reflect the owner’s WhatsApp, not the workflow creator.

### In case workflow messages did not get sent, please check the scheduled labels in WhatsApp to keep track of failed messages.


#### **Steps to ensure: **

- Open WhatsApp Web on your device with Eazybe active.


- Find the "Scheduled" or "Failed" label created by Eazybe.


- Review unsent/failed messages and their details.


- Correct issues (wrong number, integration, or network) as applicable.

### Workflow messages are not sent instantly. It takes about **2 minutes for scheduled messages to be delivered** after they are triggered.


#### **Steps to ensure: **

- After scheduling a WhatsApp message via workflow, expect a 2-minute delay before delivery.


- Wait for that period before checking for message delivery.


- If overdue, check cloud connection, scheduled labels, or integration status.

### When the same account is active on more than one device workflow messages will be getting sent multiple times.


#### **Steps to ensure: **

- Check if the **same WhatsApp number** is logged in with your **Eazybe account** on multiple devices.


- Log out from the extra devices and keep only one active session to avoid duplicate messages.
