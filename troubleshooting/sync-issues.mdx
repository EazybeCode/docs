## Overview

This guide helps you troubleshoot when WhatsApp conversations aren't syncing properly to your CRM (HubSpot, Zoho, Salesforce, etc.).

## Quick Diagnosis

Answer these questions to identify the issue:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are ANY chats syncing?">
    **If No**: Integration may be disconnected. [Check connection status](#verify-integration-connection).
    
    **If Some**: Issue is with specific contacts or labels. [Check contact matching](#contact-not-matching).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When did sync last work?">
    **Never worked**: Setup may be incomplete. [Verify setup](#verify-integration-connection).
    
    **Worked before**: Something changed. Check recent changes to permissions, labels, or settings.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's not syncing?">
    **Messages only**: Chat backup issue. [Check backup settings](#chat-backup-not-working).
    
    **Contacts**: Contact sync issue. [Check contact matching](#contact-not-matching).
    
    **Attachments**: Attachment-specific issue. [Check attachment settings](#attachments-not-syncing).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Verify Integration Connection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Connection Status">
    In Eazybe sidebar, click **Integrations**.
    
    Look for your CRM:
    - ✅ Green = Connected
    - 🔴 Red = Disconnected
    - ⚪ Gray = Never connected
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Last Sync Time">
    Go to Eazybe Workspace → Dashboard.
    
    Find "Last Chat Synced" column for your employee row. If it shows a recent time, sync is working.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reconnect if Needed">
    If disconnected:
    1. Click your CRM in Integrations
    2. Click **Reconnect** or **Connect**
    3. Re-authorize permissions
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Contact Not Matching

Contacts sync via **phone number**. If matching fails:

### Check Phone Number Format

| WhatsApp | CRM Field | Will Match? |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| +1 555 123 4567 | +15551234567 | ✅ Yes |
| +1 555 123 4567 | 5551234567 | ✅ Yes |
| +1 555 123 4567 | 555-123-4567 | ✅ Yes |
| +91 98765 43210 | 9876543210 | ❌ No (missing country code) |

<Warning>
  **Country codes matter!** If WhatsApp has +91 but CRM has just the local number, matching fails.
</Warning>

### Fix: Add Country Code to CRM

1. Open the contact in your CRM
2. Edit the phone number
3. Add the full country code (e.g., +91, +1)
4. Save
5. Wait for next sync cycle (3-5 minutes)

### Fix: Manual Linking

If auto-matching fails:
1. Open the WhatsApp chat
2. Click your CRM icon in Eazybe
3. Click **Link to Existing Contact**
4. Search and select the correct contact
5. Confirm - phone number is added to their CRM record

## Chat Backup Not Working

### Check CRM Permissions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="HubSpot">
    1. Go to HubSpot Settings → Users & Teams
    2. Click your user → Edit permissions
    3. Ensure these are enabled:
       - **App Marketplace** access
       - **Files** access
    4. If missing, contact your Super Admin
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Zoho">
    1. Go to Zoho CRM Settings → Users
    2. Check your profile permissions
    3. Ensure API access and Notes permissions are enabled
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Salesforce">
    1. Check your Salesforce profile
    2. Ensure API access is enabled
    3. Verify Activity logging permissions
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Check Activity Filter (HubSpot)

1. Open any HubSpot contact page
2. Click **Filter activity** (expand dropdown)
3. Under **Communication**, check **WhatsApp Activity**
4. If unchecked, WhatsApp chats won't display (but still sync)

### Check Label Settings

1. In Eazybe, click **Backup and Sync**
2. Review your label settings
3. Ensure the label isn't set to **Don't Sync**
4. If it is, change to **Sync** or remove contact from that label

## Attachments Not Syncing

### Check Attachment Settings

1. Go to Eazybe Settings → CRM Integration → Backup
2. Verify **Backup attachments** is enabled
3. Check file size limit (default 16MB, max 20MB)

### File Size Limits

| Attachment Type | Max Size |
|-----------------|----------|
| Images | 20 MB |
| Documents | 20 MB |
| PDFs | 20 MB |
| Videos | 16 MB |
| Voice Notes | 20 MB |

Files exceeding the limit won't sync. Reduce file size before sending.

### Supported File Types

- ✅ Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP)
- ✅ Documents (DOC, DOCX, PDF, XLS, XLSX)
- ✅ Audio (MP3, OGG, voice notes)
- ⚠️ Videos (limited support, large files may fail)
- ❌ Stickers
- ❌ Location shares

## Sync Delays

### Normal Sync Timing

| Action | Sync Time |
|--------|-----------|
| New contact creation | Immediate |
| Message backup | 3-5 minutes |
| Property updates | 1-5 minutes |
| Bulk changes | Up to 10 minutes |

### If Sync is Slower Than Expected

1. **Check your internet connection** - Unstable connection delays sync
2. **Check WhatsApp Web status** - Must stay connected
3. **Check Eazybe extension** - Refresh WhatsApp Web page
4. **High volume** - Many messages may take longer to process
