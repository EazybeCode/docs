## How Can I Confirm That the Integration Was Successful?

After completing the HubSpot integration process with the Eazybe WhatsApp extension, you will be automatically redirected to WhatsApp Web.

<Info>
The **HubSpot icon will appear in the right sidebar** of your WhatsApp Web interface. This icon confirms that your integration was completed successfully.
