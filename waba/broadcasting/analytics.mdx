## Campaign Metrics

Track these key metrics for every broadcast:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sent** | Messages submitted to WhatsApp |
| **Delivered** | Messages reached recipient's phone |
| **Read** | Messages opened by recipient |
| **Failed** | Delivery failures (invalid numbers, etc.) |
| **Replied** | Recipients who responded |

## Performance Calculations

```
Delivery Rate = (Delivered / Sent) × 100
Read Rate = (Read / Delivered) × 100
Response Rate = (Replied / Delivered) × 100
```

### Benchmarks

| Metric | Good | Great | Excellent |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| Delivery Rate | >90% | >95% | >98% |
| Read Rate | >50% | >70% | >85% |
| Response Rate | >5% | >15% | >25% |
