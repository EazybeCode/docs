- Shared within your organization
- No approval required—use instantly

For WhatsApp Business API users:
- Must be approved by Meta before use
- Required for outbound messaging to new contacts
- Categories: Marketing, Utility, Authentication
- See [WABA Templates](/waba/templates/overview) for details

Replace static text with variables that get personalized automatically:

```

Questions? Reply to this message anytime.
```

## Template Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep it conversational">
    Write like a human, not a robot. Use natural language, contractions, and appropriate emojis. Avoid corporate jargon.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include a clear CTA">
    Every template should have a clear next step—reply, click, call, confirm, etc. Make it obvious what you want the recipient to do.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Respect character limits">
    WhatsApp messages display best under 1,000 characters. For WABA templates, keep body text under 1,024 characters.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test before deploying">
    Send templates to yourself or colleagues first to catch typos, broken variables, or awkward phrasing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Update regularly">
    Review and refresh templates quarterly. Remove outdated ones and create new ones based on what's converting.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="A/B test variations">
    Create 2-3 versions of important templates and track which performs better over time.
  </Accordion>

## Organizing Templates

Use a consistent naming convention for easy searching:

| Prefix | Category | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `SALES_` | Sales outreach | SALES_initial_outreach |
| `SUPPORT_` | Customer support | SUPPORT_ticket_received |
| `OPS_` | Operations | OPS_order_shipped |
| `REMINDER_` | Reminders | REMINDER_appointment_24h |
| `FOLLOW_` | Follow-ups | FOLLOW_day3_nurture |

## Integration with CRM

Templates automatically pull data from your connected CRM:

- **HubSpot:** Contact properties, deal info, company data
- **Salesforce:** Lead/contact fields, opportunity details
- **Zoho:** Module fields, custom variables
- **LeadSquared:** Lead properties, activity data

<Info>
Variables like `{{name}}` and `{{company}}` are automatically populated from your CRM contact records when you send the message.
