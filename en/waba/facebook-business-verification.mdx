Meta uses Business Verification to confirm that companies are legally registered entities. Verified businesses unlock higher WhatsApp messaging limits, can add multiple phone numbers, and meet requirements that many WhatsApp Business Solution Providers mandate for large-scale broadcasting.

## Step-by-Step Verification Process

### Step 1: Access Meta Business Suite & Security Centre

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Business Manager">
    Go to [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com) and log in with your Facebook account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Business">
    Select the correct Business from the top-left dropdown. This should be the same one connected to your WhatsApp setup/BSP.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Business Settings">
    Click **Settings** → **Business settings** (or "More Business settings" depending on your layout).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Security Centre">
    Navigate to **Security Centre** in the left or top navigation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You will see either a "Start verification" button or an ineligibility notice based on your account status.
</Note>

### Step 2: Start the Verification Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Begin Verification">
    Click **Start verification** in the Security Centre.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Business Details">
    The wizard will request the following information:

    - **Legal business name** - Must match official documents exactly
    - **Business address** - City, state, postal code matching documents precisely
    - **Business phone number** - Any business number Meta can reach you at
    - **Website URL** - Where your legal name is clearly visible
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Continue">
    Review your information carefully and click **Next/Continue**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Ensure your legal business name matches your official documents **exactly**. Mismatches are the most common cause of verification rejection.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Upload Business Documents

Meta requires proof of your legal business name and address.

**Acceptable Documents:**
- Business registration certificate
- GST/tax certificate
- Incorporation document
- Utility bill showing address
- Bank statement
- Phone bill

<Tip>
Upload clear, readable scans or PDFs. Avoid cropped or blurred images. Use official government or tax-related documents when possible.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Confirm Business via Email, Phone, or Domain

Choose one of three verification methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Email Verification">
    Meta sends a code to your work email (e.g., name@yourcompany.com). Your email domain must match your website domain.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Phone/Text Verification">
    Meta calls or sends an SMS code to your business phone number. May require document upload showing this phone number.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Domain Verification">
    Add a DNS TXT record or upload an HTML file to your website domain following Meta's instructions. Once Meta detects it, your domain is verified.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Enter the received code or complete domain setup, then click **Verify/Continue**.

## Checking Status and Review Time

<Info>
Decisions may arrive within **a few minutes to 1-2 business days**, but can take **10-14 business days** in some cases.
</Info>

**Status Location:** Business settings → Security Center

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **In review** | Meta is processing your verification |
| **Business verified** | Verification successful |
| **Verification failed** | Rejection - see common reasons below |

**Success Indicator:** Green shield with "Business verified" label next to your business name.

## Common Rejection Reasons

<Warning>
Avoid these common mistakes to ensure successful verification.
</Warning>

| Reason | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| Name/address mismatch | Ensure form entries exactly match your documents |
| Unclear documents | Upload clear, uncropped, complete scans |
| Missing business name on website | Add legal business name to footer, About, or Contact page |
| Wrong document type | Use business registration, not personal ID |

Meta typically allows multiple attempts. Repeated failures may require an appeal or Meta support contact.
