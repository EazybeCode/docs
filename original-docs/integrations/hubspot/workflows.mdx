## Common Workflow Examples

### Welcome New Leads

**Trigger:** Contact lifecycle stage = Lead

**Action:** Send WhatsApp welcome template

```
Hi {{1}}, thanks for your interest in [Company]! 
Our team will reach out shortly. Reply to this message 
if you have any questions.
```

### Deal Stage Notification

**Trigger:** Deal stage = Proposal Sent

**Action:** Send WhatsApp with proposal details

```
Hi {{1}}, we've sent your proposal for {{2}}. 
Please review and let us know if you have questions.
[View Proposal]
```

### Follow-up Reminder

**Trigger:** 3 days after last activity

**Action:** Send WhatsApp follow-up

```
Hi {{1}}, just checking in on our conversation. 
Would you like to schedule a call this week?
```

## Template Variables

Map HubSpot properties to template placeholders:

| Template Variable | HubSpot Property |
|-------------------|------------------|
| `{{1}}` | First Name |
| `{{2}}` | Deal Name |
| `{{3}}` | Company Name |
| `{{4}}` | Custom property |

## Re-enrollment Settings

Enable **Re-enrollment** to trigger multiple times for the same contact:

1. In workflow settings, toggle **Re-enrollment** on
2. Set conditions for re-enrollment
3. Define cooldown period if needed

<Warning>
  Without re-enrollment, each contact can only trigger the workflow once.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WhatsApp action not appearing">
    - Ensure Eazybe integration is connected
    - Check that WABA is enabled
    - Refresh the workflow editor
    - Verify you have Professional/Enterprise plan
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Messages not sending">
    - Check template is approved by Meta
    - Verify phone number format in HubSpot
    - Ensure Eazybe wallet has balance
    - Check workflow execution history for errors
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Variables not populating">
    - Confirm property names match exactly
    - Check that contact has values for those properties
    - Use fallback values in templates
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

1. **Always use approved templates** - Meta requires template approval for API messages
2. **Add delays between messages** - Avoid sending multiple messages too quickly
3. **Include opt-out instructions** - Comply with messaging regulations
4. **Test with a small segment first** - Before rolling out to all contacts
5. **Monitor delivery rates** - Check workflow analytics for failures
