## What It Looks Like in HubSpot

When a new WhatsApp conversation starts, Eazybe creates a contact:

</Frame>

### Contact Record Shows:

- ✅ Phone number (with country code)
- ✅ Name from WhatsApp profile
- ✅ Lead Source = WhatsApp
- ✅ Contact Owner = Rep who received the message
- ✅ Create date = When conversation started

## Handling Existing Contacts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if the contact already exists?">
    Eazybe matches by phone number. If a contact with that phone already exists in HubSpot:
    - No duplicate is created
    - WhatsApp conversation is linked to existing contact
    - Activity is logged to existing contact's timeline
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What about phone number formats?">
    Eazybe normalizes phone numbers to E.164 format (+919876543210) before matching. This prevents duplicates from format differences.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I disable auto-create for certain reps?">
    Yes. Each team member can configure their own auto-create setting in their Eazybe settings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use consistent phone format" icon="phone">
    Ensure existing HubSpot contacts use E.164 format for accurate matching
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set meaningful defaults" icon="sliders">
    Configure Lead Source and Lifecycle Stage for easy segmentation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enable for all reps" icon="users">
    Ensure every team member has auto-create enabled
  </Card>
  <Card title="Combine with Chat Backup" icon="cloud">
    Enable chat backup so conversations are also logged
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Contacts not being created?">
    1. Verify HubSpot connection is active (Settings → Integrations)
    2. Check auto-create toggle is ON
    3. Ensure you have contact create permissions in HubSpot
    4. Check HubSpot isn't at contact limit
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Duplicate contacts appearing?">
    Phone number format mismatch. Clean up existing contacts to use E.164 format, or use HubSpot's duplicate management tool.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong contact owner assigned?">
    By default, owner = rep who received the message. To change this, configure default owner in field mapping settings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
