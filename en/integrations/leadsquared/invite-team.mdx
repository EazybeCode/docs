## What Happens After Inviting

<Info>
  Once team members accept the invitation and connect their WhatsApp:
  - They can access shared Quick Replies and Labels
  - Their chats are backed up from their WhatsApp number to the Admin's Google Drive
  - You can assign tasks to them through LeadSquared
</Info>

<Tip>
  EazyBe does not store any data on its servers. All chat backups are stored directly in your Google Drive for maximum privacy and security.
