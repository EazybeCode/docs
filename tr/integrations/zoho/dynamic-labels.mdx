## Dynamic Labels

Automatically sync Eazybe labels with Zoho CRM contact properties for seamless lead management.

### What Are Dynamic Labels?

Dynamic Labels create a two-way sync between:
- **Eazybe Labels** (applied to WhatsApp chats)
- **Zoho CRM Properties** (stored on contact records)

When you label a chat in WhatsApp, the Zoho CRM contact property updates automatically—and vice versa.

### Setting Up Dynamic Labels

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Open Eazybe → **Settings** → **Zoho CRM** → **Dynamic Labels**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Zoho CRM Property">
    Choose which Zoho CRM contact property to sync with labels.
    
    Common choices:
    - Lead Status
    - Lifecycle Stage
    - Custom dropdown property
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Map Labels to Values">
    Map each Eazybe label to a Zoho CRM property value:
    
    | Eazybe Label | Zoho CRM Value |
    |--------------|---------------|
    | Hot Lead | Qualified |
    | Warm Lead | In Progress |
    | Cold Lead | Unqualified |
    | Customer | Customer |
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Sync Direction">
    - **One-way (Eazybe → Zoho CRM)**: Labels update Zoho CRM only
    - **Two-way**: Changes sync both directions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Sync">
    Toggle **Enable Dynamic Labels** and save.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices

1. **Use consistent naming** - Match label names to Zoho CRM values
2. **Limit label count** - Too many labels cause confusion
3. **Train your team** - Ensure everyone understands the mapping
4. **Review regularly** - Audit labels monthly for accuracy

<Warning>
Changing Zoho CRM property type (e.g., from dropdown to text) will break the sync. Recreate the mapping after property changes.
</Warning>
