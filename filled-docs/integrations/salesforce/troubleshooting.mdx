Your WhatsApp conversations aren't syncing with Salesforce? You're moving your conversations forward, but the backup isn't getting stored on Salesforce. Worried about losing your chats? Don't worry! This troubleshooting guide will help you check that everything is set up correctly for syncing.

### Check Your Account- **Account Type**: Ensure you have either a **Salesforce Developer Account** or **Salesforce Professional Edition**. The integration does not support trial or Starter accounts.

- **Subscription Status**: Verify that your accounts(both Salesforce and EazyBe) are active.

## Grant AccessEazyBe asks for specific permissions when integrating with Salesforce. Ensure that these permissions are granted, as they are crucial for storing WhatsApp conversations via the EazyBe WhatsApp Extension. Make sure you accept the necessary permissions whenever prompted as it will enable smooth syncing of **WhatsApp Chats in Salesforce**.
