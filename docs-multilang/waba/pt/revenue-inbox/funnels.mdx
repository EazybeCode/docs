## Funnel Metrics

Track these KPIs per stage:

| Stage | Metrics |
|-------|---------|
| **New Lead** | Volume, source, response time |
| **Qualified** | Qualification rate, time in stage |
| **Proposal** | Win rate from proposal, deal size |
| **Negotiation** | Average discount, objection patterns |
| **Won/Lost** | Win rate, revenue, loss reasons |

## Using Labels for Funnel

1. Create labels for each stage
2. Apply labels as conversations progress
3. Filter Team Inbox by label to see stage-specific chats
4. Track movement with CRM integration

## Hot Lead Detection

Eazybe AI automatically identifies **Hot Leads** based on:

- Buying intent keywords ("I want to buy", "send invoice")
- Urgency signals ("today", "ASAP", "immediately")
- High engagement (frequent messages, quick responses)
- CRM data (high-value customer, repeat buyer)

Hot leads are flagged with 🔥 label for immediate attention.

## Follow-up Reminders

Set follow-up reminders for each funnel stage:

| Stage | Recommended Follow-up |
|-------|----------------------|
| New Lead | 1 day if no response |
| Qualified | 2 days after qualification |
| Proposal | 3 days after sending |
| Negotiation | 1 day during active negotiation |
