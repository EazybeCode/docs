## What Are Utility Templates?

Utility templates are used for **transactional, informational messages** such as:
- Order confirmations and updates
- Shipping notifications
- Appointment reminders
- Account alerts
- Payment receipts

<Info>
Utility templates cost **less than marketing** and have higher approval rates since they provide genuine value to recipients.

## Category Mismatch Warning

<Warning>
If your "utility" template contains promotional content like:
- "Check out our new products!"
- "Get 20% off your next order"
- "Limited time offer!"

It will be **rejected** and you'll need to resubmit as **Marketing**.
</Warning>
