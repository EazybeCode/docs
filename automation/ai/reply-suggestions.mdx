## Overview

Eazybe's AI suggestions help you craft better messages faster. Type your draft, and AI provides polished alternatives with different tones and styles.

## How It Works

1. **You type** a draft message (minimum 10 characters)
2. **AI analyzes** the context and content
3. **You receive** multiple rephrased options
4. **You choose** the best version or edit further
