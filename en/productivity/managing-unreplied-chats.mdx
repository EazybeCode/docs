## How Eazybe AI Chat Prioritization Works

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Automatic Chat Categorization" icon="robot">
    The AI agent scans every unreplied chat and applies a priority label (Critical or Non-Critical) based on specific indicators such as keywords (e.g., urgent, cancel, refund), customer value from your CRM, and the nature of the inquiry.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-Time Status Updates" icon="bell">
    Team members see visual labels beside chats in the Team Inbox or chat extension, highlighting high-priority conversations to act on immediately.

  <Card title="Scheduled Admin Notifications" icon="clock">
    Designated administrators receive WhatsApp message summaries every three hours listing unreplied chats, grouped by criticality to keep oversight tight.
