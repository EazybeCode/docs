## Campaign Post-Mortem Template

After each significant campaign, answer these questions:

1. **What was the goal?** (Awareness, conversions, engagement)
2. **Did we hit our targets?** (Compare actual vs expected metrics)
3. **What worked well?** (High-performing segments, templates, timing)
4. **What didn't work?** (Low engagement, high failures, negative feedback)
5. **What will we do differently?** (Specific changes for next campaign)

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set realistic expectations">
    A 5-15% response rate is excellent for promotional broadcasts. Don't expect email-like open rates (40%+) from WhatsApp—but do expect higher engagement quality.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor in real-time">
    Watch delivery and block rates during the first 50-100 messages. If failures spike, pause and investigate before continuing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Track long-term impact">
    Some responses come hours or days after the broadcast. Check metrics again 24-48 hours after sending for complete picture.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Learn from opt-outs">
    High opt-out rates signal content or frequency problems. Survey opt-outs when possible to understand why.
  </Accordion>
