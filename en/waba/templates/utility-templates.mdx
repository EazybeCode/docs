## Best Practices

<Warning>
  Avoid promotional or marketing language in utility templates. Meta may recategorize mixed-content templates to "Marketing" which has different pricing and restrictions.
</Warning>

- **Keep it concise** - Use clear, direct messaging
- **Format placeholders correctly** - Use sequential numbering (`{{1}}`, `{{2}}`, `{{3}}`)
- **Respect character limits** - Body text has a 1024 character limit
- **Be transactional** - Focus on essential information only

<Tip>
  Always test your templates with sample data before using them in production campaigns.
