To ensure a smooth integration with Eazybe, you must enable the necessary permissions for custom objects in your Zoho CRM account. This setting allows the integration to create, edit, and update custom objects seamlessly. Follow the steps below:


- **Log In to Zoho CRM**
Start by signing in to your Zoho CRM account with your administrator credentials.


- **Access Permissions Settings**
Since the current interface does not display a dedicated “Custom Object” section, navigate to your overall **Permissions** or **Customization** settings. (If you cannot locate these settings, please refer to Zoho’s latest documentation or contact Zoho support for guidance.)

- **Enable Custom Object Permissions**
Within the permissions area, look for options related to module or object management. Ensure that the following permissions are enabled for the relevant user roles or profiles:


**Create Custom Objects**


- **Edit Custom Objects**


- **Update Custom Objects**


- **Save Your Changes**
After enabling these permissions, make sure to save your settings. This will allow the Eazybe integration to manage custom objects as required.


**Note:** These permissions are crucial for the proper functioning of the Eazybe integration. Without them, the integration might not be able to sync custom objects correctly between Zoho CRM and Eazybe.
