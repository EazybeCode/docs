During the Zoho integration setup, you will be prompted to grant certain permissions. These permissions are essential for smooth syncing and backup of your WhatsApp chats with the EazyBe WhatsApp Chrome Extension, especially the **CRM permissions**.

## Required Permissions

The permissions that you are required to provide are displayed during the authorization process:

  You must accept all requested permissions for the integration to function properly. Without these permissions, EazyBe cannot sync your contacts, messages, and other CRM data between WhatsApp and Zoho.
