### Automatic Sync (every 3 minutes)

WhatsApp conversations with your LeadSquared leads are automatically synced every 3 minutes. Please note, chats will only sync with contacts who are already LeadSquared Prospectos. Once syncing begins, **the last synced date and time** will be visible in the **EazyBe extension** under the LeadSquared Mini-CRM view.

To verify if chats have synced, click on the icon to redirect to your lead's page in LeadSquared
