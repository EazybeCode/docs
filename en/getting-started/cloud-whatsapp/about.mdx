## What is Cloud?

**Cloud** allows you to sync WhatsApp conversations and schedule messages from your mobile without opening a laptop. Previously, backing up chats or sending scheduled messages required keeping your laptop on and WhatsApp Web open.

Now, with Cloud, you can manage everything from your **mobile device**, eliminating desk dependency.

<Info>
This feature enables controlling team conversations from anywhere and ensures seamless communication and message backup for your team, even when their **laptops are closed**. There's no need to rely on WhatsApp Web for syncing—Cloud handles it all.
