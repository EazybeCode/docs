## Understanding Your Messaging Setup

Depending on your configuration, you may fall into one of three user types:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Extension-Only User" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Uses the Chrome extension to sync WhatsApp conversations without a connected WABA account.
  </Card>
  <Card title="WABA-Only User" icon="whatsapp">
    Uses the Team Inbox as the primary interface for the official WhatsApp Business API.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extension + WABA User" icon="layer-group">
    Operates both channels simultaneously for maximum flexibility.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Extension-Only Users

If you're using only the Eazybe Chrome extension (without WABA), your experience is straightforward:

- Conversations sync directly from WhatsApp Web to the Team Inbox
- You can send and receive any type of message (text, media, etc.) at any time without restrictions
- No template requirements or messaging windows apply

## Key Concepts for WABA-Powered Messaging

### The 24-Hour Customer Service Window

When using WABA, a special messaging window applies to all conversations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Window Opens">
    When a customer sends you a message, a 24-hour service window opens automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Free-Form Replies">
    Within this window, you can send any type of message (text, images, documents) without needing pre-approved templates.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Time Remaining Display">
    The inbox shows the time remaining in the window (e.g., "15h 30m").
  </Step>

  <Step title="Window Closes">
    After 24 hours of customer inactivity, the window closes. You'll see: "This chat is resolved and expired."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Templates Required">
    Once the window closes, you must use an approved Message Template to re-initiate the conversation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Frame>

<Warning>
The 24-hour window resets each time the customer sends a new message. Plan your responses accordingly to stay within the active window.
</Warning>

### Dynamic Message Composer

The message composer adapts based on your conversation window status:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Window Open">
    When the 24-hour window is active, you see the standard text composer allowing free-form messaging.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/1589292361.png" alt="Standard Message Composer" />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Window Closed">
    When the window has expired, the composer is replaced with a **Send Template** button.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/1589294503.png" alt="Send Template Button" />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Sending Message Templates

When the service window is closed, follow these steps to send a template:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Send Template">
    Click the **Send Template** button that appears in place of the message composer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Template">
    Choose from your list of approved templates. You can review the template name, category, and language before selecting.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Template">
    Click to send the selected template. This will re-open the 24-hour window once the customer responds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>

</Frame>

<Tip>
Create templates for common scenarios like appointment reminders, order updates, and follow-ups to ensure you can always reach customers even outside the service window.
</Tip>

## Messaging Setup Scenarios

### Scenario A: WABA-Only User

If you only use WABA (no extension):

- You must initiate all conversations using a Message Template
- Once the customer responds, the 24-hour window opens
- Free-form messaging is available within the window
- Templates are required again after the window expires

</Frame>

### Scenario B: Dual User (Extension + WABA)

#### Different Phone Numbers

If your extension and WABA use different phone numbers:

- Conversations are separated by number filter in the inbox
- **Extension number:** Unrestricted messaging at any time
- **WABA number:** Template and window rules apply
- When initiating new chats, you'll see a selection prompt to choose which number to use

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/1589309753.png" alt="Dual User Number Selection" />
</Frame>

#### Same Phone Number

If both extension and WABA are connected to the same number:

- Conversation threads are unified
- WABA (Cloud API) becomes the default sending channel
- WABA messaging rules apply to all outbound messages

<Note>
When using the same number for both extension and WABA, the system prioritizes WABA for sending messages to ensure compliance with WhatsApp Business API policies.
</Note>

## Message Statuses

Track the delivery status of your messages using these indicators:

| Status | Icon | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Sent** | One grey tick | Message has been sent from your device |
| **Delivered** | Two grey ticks | Message has been delivered to the recipient's device |
| **Read** | Two blue ticks | Recipient has opened and read the message |
| **Failed** | Red exclamation mark | Message could not be delivered |

<Warning>
If you see a failed status, check that the recipient's number is correct and that they have an active WhatsApp account. For WABA messages, also verify that your template was approved.
</Warning>
