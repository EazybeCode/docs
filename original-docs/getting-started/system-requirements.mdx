## Performance Optimization

For best performance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Close Unused Tabs">
    Too many open tabs can slow down Chrome and affect Eazybe performance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear Browser Cache">
    Periodically clear Chrome's cache: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable Unused Extensions">
    Each extension consumes resources. Disable extensions you don't actively use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Chrome Regularly">
    Enable automatic updates or manually check for updates in Chrome settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>
