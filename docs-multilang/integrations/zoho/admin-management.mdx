On the users page, you can:

- **Edit an Existing User**: Click on an existing user’s profile and assign or modify their roles and permissions as needed.
- **Invite a New User**: If you need to add a new user, click the **Invite User** button and specify their roles and permissions during the invitation process.

By ensuring users have the correct permissions, you’ll allow seamless integration of Zoho with the EazyBe extension.
