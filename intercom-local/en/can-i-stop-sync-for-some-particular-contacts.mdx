title: "🚫 Can I stop sync for some particular contacts?"
description: ""
---

If you have many contacts connected with HubSpot but want to control which contacts’ chats get synced, you can manage sync settings for specific contacts using labels in EazyBe. Here’s how:

- **Create a Shared Label:**
- Ensure that you have created a shared label within the EazyBe WhatsApp extension.
- Add the contacts for whom you **do not** want chat backups to be synced with HubSpot under that label.

- **Access Backup and Sync Settings:**

Click on the **Backup and Sync icon** in the right sidebar of the WhatsApp extension.

  

- In the window that appears, click on the **HubSpot button**.

- **Disable Sync for Specific Contacts:**

Locate the label containing the contacts you don’t want to sync.
- Click on the **Don’t Sync button** beside the label. This will stop the chats from being synced for the contacts in that label on HubSpot.

  

- **Re-enable Sync (if needed):**

To enable sync again, click the **Sync button**.

  

- If you want to enable sync for only certain contacts, you can remove them from the label, leaving the others unchanged.
