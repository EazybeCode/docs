## Prerequisites

Before connecting HubSpot, ensure you have:

<Check>HubSpot account (Free, Starter, Professional, or Enterprise)</Check>
<Check>Admin or Super Admin access in HubSpot (for initial setup)</Check>

<Warning>

</Warning>

## Step 1: Open Integration Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open WhatsApp Web">
    Go to [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com) with the Eazybe extension active.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Connect HubSpot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Connect to HubSpot">
    Find HubSpot in the integrations list and click **Connect to HubSpot**.
    
    This opens a new window for HubSpot authorization.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select HubSpot Account">
    If you have multiple HubSpot accounts, choose the one you want to integrate.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Accept Permissions">
    Review the permissions Eazybe is requesting and click **Accept**.
    
    These permissions allow Eazybe to:
    - View and sync WhatsApp chats to HubSpot
    - Create and update contacts
    - Access deals, tasks, and tickets
    - Log activities to contact timelines
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Connection">
    You'll be redirected back to WhatsApp. Look for:
    - ✅ Green checkmark next to HubSpot in integrations
    - HubSpot icon now visible in chat sidebars
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Verify Required Permissions

Ensure your HubSpot user has these permissions enabled:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Your Permissions">
    In HubSpot, go to **Settings** → **Users & Teams** → Your profile.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify App Marketplace Access">
    Your Super Admin must grant you **App Marketplace** permission.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify File Access">
    Ensure you have **Files** permission for attachment backup.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Super Admins** automatically have all required permissions. If you're not a Super Admin, ask your HubSpot admin to grant these permissions.
</Info>

## Step 4: Configure Chat Backup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open HubSpot Contact">
    Open any HubSpot contact page (use Eazybe's **View Contact on HubSpot** button or navigate directly).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable WhatsApp Activity Filter">
    On the contact page:
    1. Click **Filter activity** (expand if collapsed)
    2. Find **Communication** section
    3. Check the box for **WhatsApp Activity**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Sync">
    Send a test message to a HubSpot contact.
    
    Wait 3-5 minutes, then check their HubSpot timeline for the synced message.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Configure Label Sync (Optional)

Control which conversations get backed up:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Backup Settings">
    In Eazybe sidebar, click **Backup and Sync**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Labels to Sync">
    Choose which labels should sync to HubSpot:
    - **Sync**: Conversations with this label backup to HubSpot
    - **Don't Sync**: Conversations excluded from backup
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to apply settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Create a "Personal" label and set it to **Don't Sync** to exclude personal conversations from HubSpot backup.
</Tip>

## Invite Team Members

After initial admin setup, team members can connect:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Team Member Installs Eazybe">
    Each team member installs the Eazybe Chrome extension.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Team Member Connects WhatsApp">
    They connect their WhatsApp to Eazybe.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Team Member Connects HubSpot">
    They follow the same steps above:
    1. Click Integrations → Connect to HubSpot
    2. Select the same HubSpot portal
    3. Accept permissions
    
    Regular user access is sufficient after admin setup.
  </Step>
</Steps>
