## What is Coexistence?

**WhatsApp Coexistence** is a Meta-provided solution that allows you to connect your active WhatsApp Business App phone number to the Cloud API without:
- Losing your chat history
- Losing your contacts
- Re-registering your number

This is the **safest method** to migrate to WABA while keeping your existing data.
