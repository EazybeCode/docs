  <Step title="Manage Users">
    From the Users page, you have two options:

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Edit Existing User" icon="user-pen">
        Modify roles and permissions for current users in your organization
      </Card>
      <Card title="Invite New User" icon="user-plus">
        Add new users and assign appropriate permissions during the invitation process
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>
