## The Problem

Sales managers can't see:
- Who's responding to WhatsApp messages?
- How fast are reps replying?
- Which reps handle the most conversations?
- Are leads being followed up?

## The Solution

Track WhatsApp performance metrics alongside HubSpot data.

## Setting Performance Targets

|--------|------------------|-----|
| First Response | < 5 minutes | Speed = conversions |
| Average Response | < 15 minutes | Keep conversations flowing |
| Daily Conversations | 20-40 per rep | Balanced workload |
| Unreplied (EOD) | 0 | No leads left hanging |

## Weekly Review Template

```markdown
## WhatsApp Performance Review - Week of {{date}}

### Team Summary

### By Rep

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review weekly, not daily">
    Daily fluctuations are normal. Focus on weekly trends.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Context matters">
    A rep handling complex enterprise deals will have different metrics than one doing quick support.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use for coaching, not punishment">
    Metrics identify improvement opportunities, not gotcha moments.
