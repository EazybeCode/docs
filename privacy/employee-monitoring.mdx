## Transparency First

When team members join your Eazybe organization, they should understand:

- Their WhatsApp work chats may be visible to managers
- Conversations backup to admin's Google Drive
- CRM sync creates activity records
- Personal chats can be excluded

## Visibility Matrix

| Feature | Employee Sees | Manager Sees | Admin Sees |
|---------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Own chats | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Team chats | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Own analytics | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Team analytics | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| All org data | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Employee Onboarding

When inviting team members:

1. **Inform**: Explain what data will be visible
2. **Configure**: Set appropriate access levels
3. **Train**: Show how to exclude personal chats
4. **Document**: Have clear policies in place
