#### Manage Your Activity
Once the activity is saved, it will be displayed in the UI. You will have options to **View Note**, postpone the activity by a certain amount of time, edit, or delete the activity by clicking on the three dots.


This allows you to keep track of activities related to your Bitrix contacts directly from your WhatsApp chats.
