### **What is a Message Template?**
A Message Template is a pre-approved message format that you can use to send outgoing notifications or start conversations with your customers. Every template must be submitted to Meta for approval to prevent spam and ensure high-quality communication on the platform.

### **How to Create a Message Template in Eazybe**

- **Go to the Templates page:** In your Eazybe dashboard, navigate to **Templates**.
​

  

- **Create New Template:** Click the **"Create Template"** button.
​

  

- **Fill in the Template Details:**

**Template Name:** A unique, lowercase name with underscores (e.g., `christmas_offer_v2`).
- **Category:** Choose the type of message (e.g., Marketing, Utility, Authentication).
- **Language:** Select the language of your template.
- **Header (Optional):** You can add a text title, an image, a video, or a document that will appear at the top of your message.
- **Body:** This is the main text of your message. 
- **Footer (Optional):** Add a short line of text at the bottom.
- **Buttons (Optional):** Add up to two buttons to your message. These can be **Quick Replies** (e.g., "Yes," "No") or **Calls to Action** (e.g., "Visit Website," "Call Us").
​

  

  

- **Submit for Approval:** Once you are happy with your template, click **"Submit"**. The template will be sent to Meta for review.
​

  

### **Checking Template Status**
You can see the status of all your templates in the **Message Templates** list.

- **Pending:** The template is under review by Meta. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours.
- **Approved:** The template is ready to be used in a broadcast!
**Rejected:** The template did not meet Meta's policies. You will see a reason for the rejection and can edit the template to resubmit it.
