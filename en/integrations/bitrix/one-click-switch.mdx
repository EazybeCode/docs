## Go to Bitrix Button

This feature provides quick access to your Bitrix account directly from WhatsApp.

<Note>
The **Go to Bitrix** button appears beside the contact or lead name at the top of the chat or within the Profile Section.
</Note>

When you click this button, you'll be instantly redirected to the respective contact's page on Bitrix. This eliminates the need to manually search for contacts in your CRM.

## Go Back to WhatsApp Button

EazyBe also offers a **Go Back to WhatsApp** button available directly within Bitrix.

<Tip>
Look for the button on the Contacts page in Bitrix. Clicking it instantly returns you to the WhatsApp conversation of the corresponding Bitrix contact.
</Tip>

This two-way navigation makes it effortless to:
- Quickly check CRM details while chatting on WhatsApp
- Return to conversations without losing context
- Maintain workflow efficiency across both platforms
