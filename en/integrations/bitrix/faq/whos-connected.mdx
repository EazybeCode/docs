The Bitrix icon will only appear for team members who have successfully connected their Bitrix account to the EazyBe extension.

## Understanding the Dashboard

The CRM integrated column shows:

- **Bitrix icon visible** - Team member has connected Bitrix
- **No icon** - Team member has not yet connected a CRM
