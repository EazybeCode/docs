## Overview

Eazybe's AI-powered chat management system helps sales and support teams efficiently manage their WhatsApp conversations by **automatically prioritizing unreplied chats**. The AI analyzes chat content, categorizes messages by urgency, and provides actionable notifications so your team can focus on what matters most.

## How AI Prioritization Works

## Critical Chat Indicators

The AI flags conversations as **Critical** when it detects:

| Indicator | Example Keywords |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Cancellation Intent** | "cancel", "stop", "terminate", "end subscription" |
| **Refund Requests** | "refund", "money back", "charge back" |
| **Complaints** | "unacceptable", "terrible", "worst", "disappointed" |
| **Urgency** | "urgent", "immediately", "ASAP", "emergency" |
| **Escalation** | "manager", "supervisor", "higher authority" |
| **CRM Data** | High-value customer, VIP tag, enterprise account |

## Administrator Notifications

Designated administrators receive **automated WhatsApp notifications** every 3 hours with:

- Count of unreplied chats
- Breakdown by Critical vs Non-Critical
- Team member with most unreplied
- Oldest unanswered conversation

<Tip>
Configure notification timing in **Settings** → **Notifications** to align with your business hours.
