## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

    Common causes:
    - Old WhatsApp version (need 2.24.17+)
    - Number inactivity

    - No Facebook Page admin access
    
    **Solution:** Use a number with active WhatsApp Business usage and no policy violations.

    Your number may need more activity before connecting. Use it actively on WhatsApp Business App for 7-30 days.
