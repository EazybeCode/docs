  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The Last Chat Synced column displays the timestamp of the most recent synchronization for each team member. This helps you identify if any team member's chats haven't been syncing properly.
</Note>

## Understanding Sync Status

Use this information to:

- **Monitor team activity** - See which team members are actively using the integration
- **Troubleshoot issues** - Identify team members with outdated sync times who may need assistance
- **Ensure compliance** - Verify that all conversations are being properly backed up

<Tip>
If a team member's last sync time is significantly outdated, they may need to refresh their WhatsApp Web session or check their browser extension status.
