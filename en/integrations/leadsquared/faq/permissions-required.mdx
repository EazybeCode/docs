Understanding the permissions required for the LeadSquared integration ensures a smooth setup and proper functionality of the EazyBe WhatsApp Chrome Extension.

## Activity Creation Permissions

<Info>
  Only **Admin and Marketing users** can create activities by default in LeadSquared.
</Info>

If other users need the ability to create activities, they must be granted **Custom Activity permissions** within LeadSquared to perform this action.

## Integration Permissions

<Warning>
  The necessary permissions will be prompted during the integration process. Be sure to grant these permissions as they are essential for:
  - Smooth syncing of your WhatsApp conversations
  - Backup of your WhatsApp chats
  - Proper functionality of the EazyBe WhatsApp Chrome Extension
</Warning>

## Required Permission Types

When setting up the integration, ensure the following permissions are granted:

- **Read access** to lead and contact data
- **Write access** for creating activities and notes
- **Custom Activity permissions** (if applicable to your user role)

<Tip>
  If you're not an Admin or Marketing user, contact your LeadSquared administrator to grant the necessary Custom Activity permissions before starting the integration.
