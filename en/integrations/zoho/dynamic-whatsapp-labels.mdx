Dynamic labels allow you to automatically organize your WhatsApp contacts using real-time Zoho CRM data. These labels are created and updated automatically, giving your team immediate visibility into key customer segments.

## About Dynamic Labels

Dynamic labels are generated based on rules you define using Zoho properties. When contacts match your specified criteria, they are automatically added to the corresponding label. When they no longer meet the conditions, they are removed automatically.

<Info>
  Dynamic labels sync in real-time with your Zoho CRM data, ensuring your WhatsApp contact organization always reflects the current state of your CRM records.
