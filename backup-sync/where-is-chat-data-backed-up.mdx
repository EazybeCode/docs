title: "Where is Chat Data Backed Up?"
description: ""
---

At **Eazybe**, we value your privacy and transparency. Depending on the features you use (CRM or Team Inbox), your WhatsApp chat data is **never stored on Eazybe’s servers** — it is either synced with your **CRM** or backed up to your **Google Drive** (if you use Team Inbox).

### 🔄 1. **CRM Integration (Zoho, HubSpot, LeadSquared, Salesforce, etc.)**

- 
When you integrate a CRM with Eazybe, your chats are **directly synced** from WhatsApp Web to your **CRM's cloud storage** via **official APIs**.

- 
Eazybe acts purely as a **data connector** — it does **not store, read, or log** any messages or attachments.

- 
CRM systems handle storage, search, retention, and encryption as per their compliance policies.


🔒 **Eazybe stores no chat content**, either temporarily or permanently, in this case.

### 👥 2. **Team Inbox Integration**


Eazybe offers a **Team Inbox** feature — a shared communication workspace for teams to manage WhatsApp conversations collaboratively.

If you enable and integrate **Team Inbox**, then:


- 
Chat data (including group and individual messages) is backed up and stored in the **user’s connected Google Drive** account.

- 
The Drive folder is either:


- 
The **user's personal Google account**, or

- 
The **company’s G Suite/Workspace Drive**, based on the account linked during setup.

✔️ **What is stored**:


- 
WhatsApp message content (text)

- 
Timestamps and senders

- 
Chat grouping

- 
Media files (if included)


❗Eazybe still **does not store** any data on its own servers — everything is stored within your own Google Drive.

### 🔐 Security & Control

- 
**You own your data**: All backups (CRM or Google Drive) stay within your control.

- 
Eazybe complies with **GDPR**, **CCPA**, and standard privacy norms.

- 
You can revoke access or disable syncing any time from your Eazybe Dashboard.

- 
No manual backups are needed — syncing is automatic based on your activity.
