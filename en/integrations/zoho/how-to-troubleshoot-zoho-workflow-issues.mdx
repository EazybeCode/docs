### To use workflows successfully with Zoho

- Ensure the **user has the Zoho workflow integration installed**.
- Once installed, you can proceed with creating and managing workflows.
​

  

### Workflow messages in Zoho are always sent from:

- The **contact owner’s** WhatsApp number, or
- The **lead owner’s** WhatsApp number

  

### For workflow messages to be delivered through Zoho, you must ensure:

- The **user has the Eazybe extension/app installed**.
- The **Zoho integration is properly connected** with Eazybe.

  

### To avoid messages being sent to the wrong recipient:

- Make sure the **phone number includes the correct country code**.
- Double-check the number format before saving it in Zoho.

  

### Media files have a size limit. To ensure successful delivery:

- Check that your **media file size does not exceed 15MB**.
- If it’s larger, compress or resize the file before attaching it to the workflow.
