## Overview

If your HubSpot workflows aren't sending WhatsApp messages as expected, this guide covers the most common issues and their solutions.

---

## 1. Email ID Registration Match

<Warning>
The email address registered on your HubSpot account and your Eazybe account **must be the same** for workflows to function correctly.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Chrome Extension">
    Ensure the Eazybe Chrome extension is properly installed and active.

</Steps>

## 2. Cloud Connection Requirement

<Info>
The **cloud connection must be active** for successful message delivery when WhatsApp Web is offline.
</Info>

Ensure your cloud connection is enabled to allow workflows to send messages even when you're not actively using WhatsApp Web.

## 3. Workflow Sender Identity

<Note>
Messages are sent **from the contact owner's or deal owner's WhatsApp number**, regardless of which user created the workflow.
</Note>

This means:
- If John is the contact owner, messages go from John's WhatsApp
- The workflow creator's number is not used unless they own the contact/deal

## 4. Failed Message Tracking

<Tip>
Check the **scheduled labels in WhatsApp** to keep track of failed messages and identify delivery issues.
</Tip>

![Scheduled Labels](/images/1677293365.png)

Use the scheduled labels feature to:
- Monitor pending messages
- Identify failed deliveries
- Retry failed messages manually if needed

---

## 5. Delivery Timing

<Info>
It takes approximately **2 minutes** for scheduled messages to be delivered after a workflow trigger fires.
</Info>

![Delivery Timing](/images/1677294496.png)

If messages aren't appearing immediately:
- Wait at least 2-3 minutes after the trigger
- Check that the workflow was properly triggered in HubSpot
- Verify the contact meets all enrollment criteria

---

## 6. Multi-Device Duplication

<Warning>
Duplicate messages occur when the **same account is active on more than one device** simultaneously.
</Warning>
