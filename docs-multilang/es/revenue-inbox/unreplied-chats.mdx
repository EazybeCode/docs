## Introducción

Eazybe’s AI-powered chat management system helps sales and support teams efficiently manage their WhatsApp conversations by prioritizing unreplied chats. This tool analyzes chat content, categorizes messages by urgency, and provides actionable notifications and filters so your team can focus on what matters most.

## How Eazybe AI Chat Prioritization Works

- **Automatic Chat Categorization:**

The AI agent scans every unreplied chat and applies a priority label. **Critical** or **Non-Critical** based on specific indicators such as keywords (e.g., urgent, cancel, refund), customer value from your CRM, and the nature of the inquiry.
- **Real-Time Status Updates:**

Team members see visual labels beside chats in the Bandeja de Equipo or chat extension, highlighting high-priority conversations to act on immediately.
- **Scheduled Admin Notifications:**

Designated administrators receive WhatsApp message summaries every three hours listing unreplied chats, grouped by criticality to keep oversight tight.

## Step-by-Step Usage Guide

## Step 1: Open Your Bandeja de Equipo

- Log in to the Eazybe workspace.

## Step 2: Identify Critical Chats

- Critical chats will have a clear red label or icon indicating high priority.
- Regularly scan this list to quickly identify issues requiring urgent attention.
Example indicators for critical chats include complaints, billing questions, order cancellations, and high-value customer alerts.
