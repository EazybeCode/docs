WhatsApp and Bitrix contacts are linked automatically through the unique phone number added in Bitrix "phone number" or "mobile" field. Moreover you can also create a new contact directly from WhatsApp using Eazybe/ Link an existing contact to a phone number in WhatsApp using Eazybe.

Moreover, once linked, the **Contact card** of the respective contact will appear in the EazyBe's mini-crm view. Both **1:1** chats and **group** chats associated with the contact will be backed up in Bitrix. The chats backed up will be visible in the Contact's page of the Bitrix Contact **.**

The chats are logged in the following way in the Contacts page:

When you create a new Bitrix contact via the **EazyBe WhatsApp extension**, the contact will be **automatically linked** to Bitrix. Once linked, your WhatsApp chats with that contact will be **backed up to Bitrix every 3 minutes**, ensuring real-time sync and data accuracy. Additionally, the **last sync time** for that contact will be updated in the EazyBe workspace, providing you with an up-to-date view of your conversation backup status.
