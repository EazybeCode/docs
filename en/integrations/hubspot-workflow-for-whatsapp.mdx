## Step-by-Step Workflow Setup

### Step 1: Create a New Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Workflows">
    In HubSpot, go to the **Automation** tab in the top menu and select **Workflows** from the dropdown.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Workflow">
    Click **Create Workflow** in the top-right corner and choose **From scratch**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Workflow Type">
    Choose the workflow type based on your needs:
    - **Contact-based:** Trigger when contact properties change
    - **Deal-based:** Trigger when deal stages change
    - **Company-based:** Trigger based on company properties
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Workflow">
    Give your workflow a descriptive name that reflects its purpose.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure Triggers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Triggers">
    Click **Set up triggers** and choose the conditions to initiate the workflow.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/1267586286.png" alt="Contact Properties Trigger Configuration" />
    </Frame>

    **Common trigger options:**
    - **Contact properties:** Trigger when a contact reaches a specific lifecycle stage
    - **Deal properties:** Trigger when a deal moves to a specific stage
    - **Custom triggers:** Define your own rules based on any property
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Filters">
    Add any additional filters to narrow down which records should enter the workflow, then save your trigger configuration.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/1267587957.png" alt="Trigger Filter Settings" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Re-enrollment">
    Turn on **Re-enrollment** to ensure the workflow triggers properly for contacts who meet the criteria multiple times.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If Re-enrollment is not enabled, contacts will only go through the workflow once, even if they meet the trigger criteria again.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Add WhatsApp Message Action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Action">
    Click the **+** icon below your trigger to add an action.

    <Frame>

  <Step title="Select WhatsApp Action">
    Scroll down and select **Send WhatsApp message** under the **EazyBe integration** section.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Configure Message Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Recipient Phone">
    Select the contact's phone field as the recipient. This ensures the message is sent to the correct WhatsApp number.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Message">
    Write your message content. You can use **contact tokens** to personalize the message with:
    - Contact name
    - Company name
    - Deal information
    - Custom properties
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Media (Optional)">
    If needed, add a **Media URL** to include documents or files with your message.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use personalization tokens like `{{contact.firstname}}` to make your messages feel more personal and increase engagement rates.
</Tip>

    Review your workflow configuration to ensure all steps are correctly set up.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Workflow">

This setup allows you to schedule automated WhatsApp messages at the perfect time, ensuring consistent follow-ups and engagement with your leads.
</Note>

## Important Considerations

### Sender Information

When adding a WhatsApp action in a workflow, the sender will reflect the **owner's WhatsApp**, not the workflow creator. Ensure the appropriate team member's WhatsApp is connected.

### Contact Phone Numbers

WhatsApp and HubSpot contacts are linked automatically through the unique phone number in HubSpot's "phone number" field. Make sure contact phone numbers are correctly formatted with country codes.

### Workflow Timing

Consider the timing of your automated messages:
- Avoid sending messages at inappropriate hours
- Use delays between actions if sending multiple messages
- Test your workflow with a small group before scaling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WhatsApp action not appearing in workflow?">
    Ensure that Eazybe is properly connected to HubSpot. You may need to reconnect the integration or refresh the workflow editor.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Messages not being sent?">
    Check that:
    - WhatsApp Web is open with Eazybe active
    - The contact has a valid phone number
    - Re-enrollment is enabled if needed
    - The workflow is published and active
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong sender appearing on messages?">
    The sender reflects the HubSpot contact owner's WhatsApp. Verify that contact ownership is correctly assigned in HubSpot.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
