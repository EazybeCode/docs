This feature allows admins to control which HubSpot properties a specific team can edit. With this, you can ensure data consistency and secure your organization's HubSpot data access.

---

### ✅ **What This Feature Does**

- Lets admins assign “edit permissions” to properties based on teams
- Supports multiple CRM modules: **Contacts, Deals, and Tickets**
- Ensures only authorized teams can modify key data fields
- Requires a final “Apply” step to activate settings

---

### 👥 **Who Can Use This Feature**

- **Admins only** — team-level permissions cannot be managed by regular users

---

### **How to Set Edit Properties for Teams**
Follow these steps to configure edit permissions:

### **Step 1: Select a Team**

- Navigate to **Edit Properties Settings in HubSpo**
​

  

​
- Choose the **team** for which you want to define editable properties

  

This determines which users will be impacted by your settings.

---

### **Step 2: Select a Module**

  

Choose the CRM module where you want to set permissions:

- **Contacts**
- **Deals**
- **Tickets**

You must repeat this process for each module if needed.

---

### **Step 3: Select Edit Properties**

- A list of properties will appear
- Check the properties you want the selected team to **edit**
- Leave unchecked any property that should be **read-only** for that team

Example: Sales team can edit deal stage, but Support cannot.

---

### **Step 4: Save Settings**

  

- Click **Save** to record your configuration

Saving stores your preferences — but does **not** apply them yet.

---

### **Step 5: Apply the Changes**

- Go to **Extensions**
- Open the Edit Properties extension settings
- Click **Apply**

  

This final step activates the permissions for all users in the selected team.

---

### ⚠️ Important Notes

Settings won’t take effect until you click **Apply**
- You can modify permissions anytime by repeating the steps
- Users may need to refresh CRM pages to see updated access rules
