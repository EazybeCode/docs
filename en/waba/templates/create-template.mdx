This guide explains how to create and use Message Templates to send a broadcast (or initiate any conversation) with WABA.

## What is a Message Template?

A Message Template is a pre-approved message format that allows you to send outbound notifications or start conversations with your customers. Every template must be submitted to Meta for approval to prevent spam and ensure high-quality communication.

<Info>
Message Templates are required for initiating conversations outside the 24-hour messaging window or sending broadcast campaigns.
