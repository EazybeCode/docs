## About Dynamic Labels

Dynamic Labels are WhatsApp labels that are automatically generated based on rules you define using HubSpot properties. When a contact matches the specified criteria, they are automatically added to the label. Similarly, when a contact no longer meets the criteria, they are automatically removed.

This ensures your WhatsApp communication stays aligned with the most current customer information in your CRM.
