## Attachment Sync Is Not Working. What Can I Do?

<Warning>
If your attachment synchronization is not working, this is usually related to **file permissions** not being properly configured.
</Warning>

## How to Fix Attachment Sync Issues

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check File Permissions">
    First, verify that the necessary file permissions have been granted for the HubSpot integration. Without proper permissions, attachments cannot be synced.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant Required Permissions">
    If permissions are missing, grant the required file access permissions in your HubSpot integration settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disconnect the Integration">
    After granting permissions, disconnect your current HubSpot integration from the Eazybe extension.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reconnect the Integration">
    Reconnect your HubSpot account to the Eazybe extension. This will refresh the connection with the new permissions applied.
  </Step>
</Steps>
