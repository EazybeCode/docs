All charges for sending WhatsApp broadcasts and initiating conversations are handled through your Eazybe Wallet, giving you a clear and centralized way to manage your spending.

### **How the Eazybe Wallet Works**
Every time you send a template message to a customer, a small fee is deducted from your Wallet balance. 

- **Your Starter Credits:** Every business gets **1,000 free conversations** from Meta each month. These will be used first before your paid balance is touched.
- **Topping Up Your Balance:** For usage beyond the free tier, you must add funds to your wallet.

### **How to Recharge Your Wallet**

- **Navigate to the Wallet:** In your Eazybe dashboard, go to the **Wallet** section from the main menu. Here you can see your current balance and transaction history.
- **Click Recharge:** Click the **"+ Recharge"** button.
- **Enter Amount & Pay:** A popup will appear. Enter the amount you wish to add (e.g., `₹1000`) and click **"Pay Now"**.
- **Complete Payment:** You will be directed to our secure payment gateway to complete the transaction.

The new balance will be reflected in your wallet immediately, ensuring your campaigns can run without interruption.
