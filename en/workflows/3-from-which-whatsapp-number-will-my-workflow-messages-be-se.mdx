title: "3. From which WhatsApp number will my workflow messages be sent"
description: ""
---

Workflow messages are always sent from the contact owner’s or the deal owner’s WhatsApp number regardless of which user created the workflow.

- Assign the correct owner to each contact or deal in HubSpot.
- Confirm the owner’s WhatsApp number is integrated via Eazybe.
- When adding a WhatsApp action in a workflow, the sender will reflect the owner’s WhatsApp, not the workflow creator.
