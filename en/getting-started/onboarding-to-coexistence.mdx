## What is WhatsApp Coexistence?

Coexistence (Coex) allows businesses to:

- Connect the WhatsApp Business App to the Cloud API
- Continue using the Business App normally
- Sync messages and contacts into a Cloud API platform
- Avoid re-registering the number
- Preserve the Verified badge (if applicable)

**Key Benefits:**

- Use the same phone number across both Business App and API
- Real-time message and contact synchronization
- Combine human interaction with automation
- Preserve chat history and contacts
- Maintain access to the familiar WhatsApp Business App interface

<Note>
This is the safest method to migrate to Cloud API without losing data.
