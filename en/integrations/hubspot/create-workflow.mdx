## Setting Up Your Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Workflow">
    Navigate to the **Automation** tab in HubSpot and select **Workflows** from the dropdown menu. Click **Create workflow** and choose **From scratch**.

    Select the workflow type based on your needs:
    - **Contact-based** — Trigger based on contact properties
    - **Deal-based** — Trigger based on deal stage changes
    - **Company-based** — Trigger based on company properties

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Trigger">
    Give your workflow a descriptive name, then click **Set up triggers** to define the conditions that will initiate the workflow.

    Choose from available trigger options:
    - **Contact properties** — Trigger when a contact reaches a specific lifecycle stage
    - **Deal properties** — Trigger on deal stage changes
    - **Custom triggers** — Define your own conditions

    <Warning>
      Make sure to enable **Re-enrollment** if you want the workflow to trigger multiple times for the same contact when they meet the conditions again.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Eazybe WhatsApp Action">
    Click the **+** icon below your trigger to add an action. Scroll down through the available actions and select **Send WhatsApp message** under the **Eazybe** integration section.
