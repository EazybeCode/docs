When you create a new ZOHO contact via the **EazyBe WhatsApp extension**, the contact will be **automatically linked** to ZOHO. Once linked, your WhatsApp chats with that contact will be **backed up to ZOHO every 3 minutes**, ensuring real-time sync and data accuracy.

Additionally, the **last sync time** for that contact will be updated in the EazyBe workspace, providing you with an up-to-date view of your conversation backup status.
