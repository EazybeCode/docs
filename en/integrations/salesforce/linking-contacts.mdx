This guide explains how WhatsApp and Salesforce contacts are linked, enabling automatic chat backup and synchronization.

## How Contact Linking Works

WhatsApp and Salesforce contacts link automatically through phone numbers stored in Salesforce's **Phone Number** or **Mobile** fields. You can also:

- Create contacts directly from WhatsApp using EazyBe
- Link existing Salesforce contacts to WhatsApp phone numbers

## What Happens After Linking

<Info>
  Once linked, the contact card appears in EazyBe's Mini-CRM view, giving you instant access to contact details while chatting.
</Info>

Both 1:1 chats and group chats associated with the contact will be backed up to Salesforce:

- **For Contacts**: Chat content and attachments display in the Notes and Attachments Section and WhatsApp Chats by EazyBe Activity object
- **For Leads**: Chats appear in the WhatsApp Chats by Activity Objects
