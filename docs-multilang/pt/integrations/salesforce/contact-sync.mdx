WhatsApp and Salesforce contacts are linked automatically through the unique phone number added in Salesforce "phone number" or "mobile" field. Moreover you can also create a new contact directly from WhatsApp using Eazybe/ Link an existing contact to a phone number in WhatsApp using Eazybe.

Moreover, once linked, the **Contact card** of the respective contact will appear in the EazyBe's mini-crm view. Both **1:1** chats and **group** chats associated with the contact will be backed up Salesforce. The chats(inclusive of attachments) backed up will be visible in the **Notas and Attachments Section** in Salesforce and **WhatsApp Chats by EazyBe** Activity object for Contatos and in case of the Leads, they are backed up in the WhatsApp Chats by Activity Objects.

The 1:1 Chats are logged in the following way in the Contatos page:

In the case of group chats, the chats will be backed up in a similar manner.

When you create a new Salesforce contact via the **EazyBe WhatsApp extension**, the contact will be **automatically linked** to Salesforce. Once linked, your WhatsApp chats with that contact will be **backed up to Salesforce every 3 minutes**, ensuring real-time sync and data accuracy. Additionally, the **last sync time** for that contact will be updated in the EazyBe workspace, providing you with an up-to-date view of your conversation backup status.
