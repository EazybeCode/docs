## Creating Effective Templates

### Use Dynamic Variables
Replace static text with variables that get filled in automatically:

```
Hi {{name}},

Your order #{{order_id}} has been shipped!
Expected delivery: {{delivery_date}}

Track here: {{tracking_link}}
```

### Available Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{name}}` | Contact's name | John |
| `{{company}}` | Company name | Acme Inc |
| `{{date}}` | Current date | Jan 11, 2026 |
| `{{time}}` | Current time | 2:30 PM |
| `{{custom}}` | Custom field | Any value |
