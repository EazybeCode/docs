WhatsApp and HubSpot contacts are linked automatically through the unique phone number added in HubSpot "phone number" or "mobile" field. Moreover you can also create a new contact directly from WhatsApp using Eazybe/ Link an existing contact to a phone number in WhatsApp using Eazybe. 

Moreover, once linked, the **Contact card** of the respective contact will appear in the EazyBe's mini-crm view. Both **1:1** chats and **group** chats associated with the contact will be backed up in HubSpot.

**1:1 chats** are logged in the following way:

  

In the case of logging a **group chat**, the chats of the respective individual contacts participating in the group will be **visible on the HubSpot contact page of the group**. The group itself will have a **unique phone number**, which might appear **longer than a typical phone number**. This distinct number is used to identify and log group conversations within HubSpot, ensuring that chats are stored correctly and associated with the group's contact record.

  

When you create a new HubSpot contact via the **EazyBe WhatsApp extension**, the contact will be **automatically linked** to HubSpot. Once linked, your WhatsApp chats with that contact will be **backed up to HubSpot every 3 minutes**, ensuring real-time sync and data accuracy. Additionally, the **last sync time** for that contact will be updated in the EazyBe workspace, providing you with an up-to-date view of your conversation backup status.

  

After integrating HubSpot with the EazyBe WhatsApp extension, the contacts you create on HubSpot will also be visible within the WhatsApp extension. This seamless integration allows you to view and manage your HubSpot contacts directly through the WhatsApp interface, ensuring that all your important contact information is easily accessible and synchronized.
