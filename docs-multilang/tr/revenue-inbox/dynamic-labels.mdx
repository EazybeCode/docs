Dynamic WhatsApp Etiketler allow you to automatically organize your WhatsApp contacts based on real-time Zoho CRM data. Once set up, these labels are created and updated automatically, giving your team immediate visibility into key customer segments directly within WhatsApp—without any manual effort.

This feature ensures that your WhatsApp communication stays aligned with the most current customer information in Zoho.

## **About Dinamik Etiketler**

Dinamik Etiketler are WhatsApp labels generated and maintained based on rules you define using Zoho properties. When a contact in Zoho matches the criteria you specify, they are automatically added to the corresponding WhatsApp label. If a contact no longer meets the criteria, they are removed.

This ensures all labels remain accurate and up to date.
