## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review weekly">
    Schedule a weekly analytics review to spot trends early and adjust strategy. Monday mornings work well for planning the week ahead.

    Look at week-over-week and month-over-month trends rather than single data points. Outliers can be misleading.
  </Accordion>

    Compare messaging metrics with sales/support outcomes to understand what actually drives results.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Share insights with team">
