  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Act on red flags quickly">
    When you see warning signs like increasing non-response rates, investigate immediately. Small issues become big problems if ignored.

  <Accordion title="Compare apples to apples">
    When analyzing, compare similar time periods (this Tuesday vs last Tuesday) rather than different conditions (weekday vs weekend).
  </Accordion>
