If your WhatsApp conversations aren't syncing with Zoho despite moving conversations forward, this guide will help you resolve the issue.

## Common Cause: Permission Issues

EazyBe requires specific permissions when integrating with Zoho. These permissions are crucial for storing WhatsApp conversations via the EazyBe WhatsApp Extension.

## How to Fix the Sync Issue

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify CRM Permissions">
    Ensure that you are part of an organization with **CRM permissions** access. Without these permissions, WhatsApp chats cannot be synced to Zoho.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Join or Create an Organization">
    If you are not already in an organization with the required permissions, you need to either:
    - Join an existing organization that has CRM permissions
    - Create a new organization to enable proper syncing of WhatsApp chats in Zoho
  </Step>

  <Step title="Re-grant Permissions">
    If permissions were denied during initial setup, disconnect and reconnect the integration to be prompted for permissions again. Make sure to accept all required permissions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Without the proper CRM permissions granted, EazyBe cannot store your WhatsApp conversations in Zoho. Ensure all permissions are accepted during the integration process.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Organization-level CRM permissions are required for the sync to work properly. Individual user permissions may not be sufficient.
