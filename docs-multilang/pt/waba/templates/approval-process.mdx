## Approval Timeframes

Meta uses a combination of automated AI and human review processes. While official guidelines state approvals can take up to **24 hours**, most templates are processed much faster.

***Pro Tip: Plan your campaigns at least 24 hours in advance to account for potential review delays.***

## Template Categories Visão Geral

Ensure you select the correct category to avoid rejection or "mis-categorisation" penalties.

## 1. Modelos Utilitários

**Purpose:** Facilitate a specific, agreed-upon transaction or update.

- **Use Cases:** Order confirmations, shipping updates, account balance alerts, appointment reminders.
- **Constraint:** Must **not** contain any upsell, vague introductory "warm-up" messages, or promotional language.
- **Approval Expectation:** Generally faster (minutes) if variables are clear (e.g., **#{{1}}** for order ID).

## 2. Modelos de Marketing

**Purpose:** Promote products, services, or brand awareness.

- **Use Cases:** Discount offers, newsletters, abandoned cart recovery, welcome series.
- **Constraint:** Flexible content, but strictly monitored for "spammy" language or policy violations.
- **Approval Expectation:** Subject to stricter scrutiny regarding user consent and content quality.

## Constraints & Requirements for Successful Approval

To ensure your templates are approved without delay, adhere to these Meta constraints:

## Content & Formatting

- **Variable Parameters:** Always provide **samples** for your variables (e.g., **#{{1}}** = "John"). Meta rejects templates with unclear variables.
- **Grammar & Spelling:** Modelos with spelling errors or poor grammar are automatically rejected as "low quality."
- **Link Shorteners:** Do not use generic link shorteners (like bit.ly) in the body text; they obscure the destination URL and trigger security flags. Use the specific "Button" feature for links.

## Policy Compliance

- **No Mixed Categories:** Do not blend Utility and Marketing. Example: *"Your order #123 is confirmed. Check out our new arrivals!"* — This will be rejected as a Utility template.
- **Restricted Content:** Avoid requesting sensitive identifiers (credit card numbers, full distinct ID numbers) or using threatening or scammy languages (e.g., *"Pay now or legal action will be taken"*).
- **Category Consistency:** If Meta’s system detects that your "Utility" template is actually "Marketing," they will auto-update the category. You have **60 days** to appeal this change if you disagree.

## Understanding Template Statuses

- **Pending:** The template is currently under review by Meta.
- **Approved:** The template is approved and ready to send.
- **Rejected:** The template failed review. Check the "Reason" provided in the dashboard (e.g., "Promotional content in Utility").
- **Paused:** The template has been flagged for low quality (high block rates from users). You cannot send it until the quality score improves.
