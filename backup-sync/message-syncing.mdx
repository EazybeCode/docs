#### Automatic Sync (every 3 minutes)
WhatsApp conversations with your HubSpot contacts are automatically synced every **3 minutes**. Please note, that chats with HubSpot contacts will only be synced and you can manage selective sync using Sync settings option inside HubSpot Mini-CRM view. 


Once the syncing of the chats begins, the last synced date and time will be visible in the EazyBe extension.
