We prioritize the privacy of our customers and do not store any contact chat data on our servers. The only data we collect is the essential contact information required to provide our services.

Users have full control over their data and can manage, update or delete their information as they see fit.

When transferring data to third-party CRMs, we use an encrypted channel process, ensuring that Eazybe does not retain any data during this transfer.

We comply with all General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) policies and are in the process of applying for certification.
