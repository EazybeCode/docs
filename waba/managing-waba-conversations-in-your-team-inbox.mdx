The **Team Inbox** is your collaborative hub for all customer conversations on your WABA number.


### **1. Understanding Your Messaging Setup**
First, it's important to identify which Eazybe setup you are using, as this determines the features and rules that apply to you.


- **Extension-Only User:** You use the Eazybe Chrome extension to sync your standard or WhatsApp Business app conversations from your phone to the Team Inbox. You have not connected a WABA account.


- **WABA-Only User:** You use the Eazybe Team Inbox as the main interface for your official WhatsApp Business API number. You do not use the Chrome extension for this number.


- **Extension + WABA User :** You use both the Chrome extension (for one number) and have a separate WABA number connected to Eazybe. This could be the same number for both (Coexistence if WhatsApp Business number) or two different numbers.


### **2. For Extension-Only Users**
If you are an Extension-Only user, **your experience in the Team Inbox remains unchanged.**


- **Syncing:** Your conversations are synced directly from your WhatsApp Web session.


- **Messaging:** You can send and receive any type of message (text, media, etc.) at any time without restrictions, just as you would on your phone.


### **3. Key Concepts for WABA-Powered Messaging**
If you have a WABA number connected, your messaging capabilities are governed by WhatsApp's policies. Here are the core concepts you need to understand.


### **The 24-Hour Customer Service Window**
To encourage timely responses, WhatsApp enforces a "24-Hour Customer Service Window."


- **What it is:** When a customer sends you a message, a 24-hour window opens. Within this window, you can reply with free-form messages (any text or media).


- **Window OPEN:** The Team Inbox will display the time remaining in the service window (e.g., "15h 30m"). You can chat freely.


- **Window CLOSED:** Once 24 hours have passed since the last customer message, the window closes. The Team Inbox will show "This chat is resolved and expired." You can no longer send free-form messages. You can only send a template message when the window is closed.


### **The Dynamic Message Composer**
The message input area in your Team Inbox will automatically adapt based on the status of the 24-hour window.


- **Window OPEN:** You will see a standard, free-form message composer where you can type any message.

- **Window CLOSED:** The free-form composer will be replaced by a **Send Template** button. You MUST use a pre-approved Message Template to re-initiate the conversation.

### **Sending Message Templates**
When the service window is closed or to initiate a new conversation, you must use a Message Template.


- Click the **Send Template** button.


- A pop-up will appear, allowing you to select from your list of approved templates. You can search for the template you need.


- Each template will show its name, category (e.g., Utility, Marketing) and language.


- Select the desired template to send it.


### **4. How Messaging Works for Your Specific Setup**

### **Scenario A: WABA-Only User**

- **To start a new conversation:** You must begin by sending a Message Template. From your Team Inbox, open a new chat, choose your contact, and you will be prompted to select a template.


- **To reply to a customer:**


If the 24-hour service window is **open**, you can type and send free-form messages.


- If the 24-hour service window is **closed**, you must use the Send Template button to send a Message Template.


### **Scenario B: Dual User (Extension + WABA)**
This setup requires clear separation and awareness of which channel you are using.


**1. Using DIFFERENT Numbers for Extension and WABA**

This is the most straightforward dual existence model.


- **Clear Separation:** The Team Inbox will separate conversations based on the number selected from the filter dropdown, indicating whether they belong to your extension-synced number or your WABA number.

- **Contextual Rules:**


When you are in a chat from your **extension-synced number**, you can send messages freely at any time.


- When you are in a chat from your **WABA number**, all the WABA rules (24-hour window, templates) apply.


- **Initiating New Chats **(WABA number)**:** When starting a new conversation, you will be prompted to **Choose Contact** and select which number you want to send the message *from*.

**2. Using the SAME Number for Extension and WABA**

This powerful setup unifies your communication channels.


- **Unified View:** Conversations from the same contact are merged into a single thread, whether the message came via the API or was synced from your phone app. 


- **WABA is Default:** To ensure compliance and leverage API features, any message you send from the Team Inbox will **default to using the WABA (Cloud API)** channel.


- **WABA Rules Apply:** Because the WABA channel is the default, the messaging composer will follow WABA rules (free-form in the open window, templates required when closed).


### **5. WABA Message Statuses and Errors**
The Team Inbox will display message statuses just like WhatsApp:


- **Sent:** One grey tick.


- **Delivered:** Two grey ticks.


- **Read:** Two blue ticks.


- **Failed:** A red exclamation mark.
