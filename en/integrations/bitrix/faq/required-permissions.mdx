---

When integrating EazyBe with Bitrix, you will be prompted to grant certain permissions during the setup process. These permissions are essential for the integration to function properly.

## Why Permissions Are Needed

The requested permissions enable smooth syncing and backup of your WhatsApp chats with the EazyBe WhatsApp Chrome Extension. Without these permissions, the integration cannot:

- Access your Bitrix contacts
- Sync WhatsApp conversations
- Create and update CRM records
- Store chat history in your Bitrix account

## Permission Request Screen

During the integration setup, you will see a permissions screen similar to this:

<Note>
You must accept all requested permissions for the integration to work correctly. Declining any permission may result in limited or no functionality.
</Note>

## Permissions Checklist

When prompted, ensure you grant access for:

- **CRM Access** - Read and write access to contacts and leads
- **Activity Management** - Ability to create and manage activities
- **Timeline Access** - Permission to add entries to contact timelines
- **User Information** - Basic access to identify the connected account

<Tip>
All permissions are used solely for syncing your WhatsApp conversations with Bitrix. EazyBe does not share your data with third parties.
