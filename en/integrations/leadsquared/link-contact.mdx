The EazyBe WhatsApp Extension establishes connections between your WhatsApp contacts and leads in your LeadSquared account by linking mobile numbers.

## How Contact Linking Works

Once a WhatsApp contact is linked to a LeadSquared lead:

- The contact card displays in the EazyBe extension's interface
- Conversations are automatically backed up in LeadSquared
- You can access lead details directly from WhatsApp
