#### What is Cloud?

**Cloud** allows you to sync your WhatsApp conversations and schedule messages on the go without the need to open your laptop. Previously, backing up chats or sending scheduled messages required keeping your laptop on and WhatsApp Web open. 

Now, with Cloud, you can manage everything from your **mobile device**, eliminating the hassle of being tied to your desk.

This feature enables you to control your team's conversations from anywhere and ensures seamless communication and message backup for your team, even when their **laptops are closed**. There's no need to rely on WhatsApp Web for syncing Cloud does it all.

#### Features of Cloud
