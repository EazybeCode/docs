## What is Coexistence?

**Coexistence** is a Meta-provided feature that allows you to connect your active **WhatsApp Business App** phone number to the **WhatsApp Cloud API** without:

- Losing your chat history
- Re-registering the number
- Losing your verified badge
- Abandoning your existing workflow

Messages sync in real-time between both platforms, so your team can use the API while you continue using the mobile app.
