A **super-admin** on HubSpot has the authority to invite new users to the organisation and

manage their permissions. Here's how to grant permissions for seamless integration of HubSpot with EazyBe:

### Giving Permissions Through HubSpot

- 
#### Access the Settings Page
Log in to HubSpot and navigate to the **Settings **page.

  

- 
#### Manage Users & Teams
In the settings, click on **Users & Teams**.

  

- 
#### Edit User Permissions
Locate the user whose permissions you want to manage and click on **Edit permissions** button beside their name

  

- 
#### Grant Required Permissions
Ensure that necessary permissions are granted, especially:

**File permissions and App Marketplace permissions**

  

These permissions are essential for ensuring smooth integration of EazyBe with HubSpot and to enable key functionalities like chat backup and CRM sync.
