## What is Revenue Inbox?

The **Revenue Inbox** is Eazybe's centralized command center where managers and team leads can monitor all WhatsApp conversations across their entire team. It uses AI to automatically detect:

  </Card>
  <Card title="⚠️ Escalations" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Unhappy customers, complaints, refund requests, or cancellation intent
  </Card>
  <Card title="⏰ Unreplied Chats" icon="clock">
    Conversations waiting for a response beyond your SLA threshold

  </Step>
  <Step title="Manager Visibility">
