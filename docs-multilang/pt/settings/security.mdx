## Data Handling & Storage

## Encryption & Infrastructure

- **Data in Transit**: Encrypted with TLS/HTTPS
- **Data at Rest**: Backed-up data is encrypted using Google Drive’s built-in encryption
- **Access Controls**: Strict role-based access internally
- **Endpoint Segurança**: Only authorized devices can access infrastructure
- **Production Firewalls**: Deny-by-default rules active

## Backup de Conversas Defaults (Caixa da Equipe)

When Caixa da Equipe is enabled, **all WhatsApp chats are backed up by default** to your connected Google Drive.

**But you’re in control:**

- Use the **"Don’t Sync" label** to exclude specific contacts.
- Admins can manage sync rules org-wide - including what gets backed up and what doesn’t.
