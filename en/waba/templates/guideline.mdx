This guide covers everything you need to know about WhatsApp message template approval timelines, guidelines, and best practices to ensure successful template creation.

## Approval Timeframes

Meta employs automated AI combined with human review for template approvals. While official guidance permits approvals within **24 hours**, most templates process much faster.

| Scenario | Estimated Time | Context |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Standard Approval** | 1-5 Minutes | Well-structured templates approved nearly instantly |
| **Complex/Flagged** | 1-24 Hours | AI-detected ambiguous content routed for human review |
| **Re-Submission** | Up to 24 Hours | Rejected templates or category changes require verification |

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** Plan your campaigns at least 24 hours in advance to account for potential review delays.
</Tip>

## Constraints & Requirements for Successful Approval

### Content & Formatting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Variables" icon="code">
    Always provide sample values for variables.

    **Example:** `{{1}}` = "John"

    Unclear variables without samples will trigger rejection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Grammar & Spelling" icon="spell-check">
    Errors in grammar or spelling result in automatic rejection as "low quality" content.

    Always proofread your templates before submission.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Link Shorteners" icon="link">
    **Do not use** generic link shorteners (like bit.ly) in the body text.

    They obscure the destination URL and trigger security flags.

    <Tip>
    Use WhatsApp's built-in button features instead of embedding shortened links in text.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Policy Compliance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No Mixed Categories" icon="layer-group">
    Blending utility and marketing content in a single template causes rejection.

    Keep your template purpose clear and consistent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Restricted Content" icon="ban">
    Avoid:
    - Sensitive identifiers (financial data, health information)
    - Threatening or coercive language
    - Content that violates WhatsApp policies
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Category Consistency" icon="tags">
    Meta may auto-detect and change miscategorized templates.

    You have **60 days to appeal** this change if you disagree with the recategorization.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Template Statuses

| Status | Icon | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Pending** | 🟡 | Currently under Meta review |
| **Approved** | 🟢 | Ready to send to customers |
| **Rejected** | 🔴 | Failed review; check dashboard for reason |
| **Paused** | ⏸️ | Flagged for low quality (high block rates); cannot send until quality improves |

<Warning>
If your template is **Paused**, review your message content and sending practices. High block rates indicate recipients are marking your messages as spam.
</Warning>
