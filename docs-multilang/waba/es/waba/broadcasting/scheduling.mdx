## Why Schedule?

Scheduling broadcasts lets you:
- Send at optimal times for your audience
- Prepare campaigns in advance
- Coordinate with other marketing activities
- Target different time zones effectively

## How to Schedule

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Broadcast">
    Follow normal broadcast creation steps:
    - Select template
    - Upload contacts
    - Fill variables
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Schedule Option">
    Instead of "Send Now", select **"Schedule for Later"**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Date & Time">
    Choose:
    - Date (calendar picker)
    - Time (24-hour format)
    - Timezone (defaults to your account timezone)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Schedule">
    Review details and click **Schedule Broadcast**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Scheduled Broadcasts

View all scheduled campaigns in **Broadcasts** → **Scheduled**:

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **View details** | Click campaign name |
| **Edit** | Click Edit (only before scheduled time) |
| **Reschedule** | Change date/time |
| **Cancel** | Delete scheduled broadcast |

<Warning>
You cannot edit a broadcast once it starts sending. Make changes before the scheduled time.
</Warning>

## Best Times to Send

Based on general engagement data:

| Day | Best Times (Local) |
|-----|-------------------|
| Monday-Friday | 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM |
| Monday-Friday | 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM |
| Weekend | 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM |

<Tip>
Test different times and track read rates to find what works best for YOUR audience.
</Tip>

## Time Zone Considerations

If your audience spans multiple time zones:
- Create separate broadcasts for each region
- Schedule at optimal local time for each
- Use country-specific contact lists

## Recurring Broadcasts

Currently, each broadcast must be scheduled individually. For recurring campaigns:
1. Create the campaign
2. Duplicate after completion
3. Update content and reschedule
