The EazyBe WhatsApp Extension links your WhatsApp contacts to leads in your LeadSquared account by linking the mobile numbers. Once the contacts are linked, the **Contact Card** of the respective lead will appear in the extension's UI. The WhatsApp conversations of the respective contact will be automatically backed up in LeadSquared

Whenever you create a new LeadSquared lead via the EazyBe WhatsApp Extension, the lead is instantly added to LeadSquared, and the chats are backed up every **3 minutes**.
