## What are Plantillas de Utilidad?

Utility templates are pre-approved messages used to send transactional information to customers who have opted in to receive notifications from you. These messages are typically triggered by a specific user action or request, such as a purchase or a sign-up. Unlike marketing messages, utility templates are meant for non-promotional content and focus on providing essential information or updates related to a customer's ongoing transaction or account.​

​

## When to Use Plantillas de Utilidad

Utility templates are ideal for a variety of transactional scenarios, including:

- **Order Confirmations and Updates:** Send automatic notifications about a customer's order status, including confirmation, shipping, and delivery updates.​
- **Appointment Reminders:** Help customers remember their upcoming appointments, reservations, or events.​
- **Account and Subscription Alerts:** Inform users about important updates to their accounts, such as payment reminders or subscription changes.​
- **Opt-In Confirmations:** Confirm a user's subscription to your WhatsApp notifications.
- **Feedback Surveys:** Request feedback from customers after a transaction or interaction.
