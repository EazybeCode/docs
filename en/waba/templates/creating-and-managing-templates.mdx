## What is a Message Template?

Message Templates are essential for WhatsApp Business API (WABA) users who want to:

- **Initiate conversations** with customers outside the 24-hour messaging window
- **Send broadcasts** to multiple contacts at once
- **Automate notifications** such as order confirmations, appointment reminders, or shipping updates

<Note>
All Message Templates must be approved by Meta before they can be used. This ensures compliance with WhatsApp's messaging policies and helps maintain a high-quality user experience.

## Best Practices for Template Approval

To increase your chances of getting templates approved quickly:

1. **Be clear and concise:** Avoid vague or ambiguous language
2. **Follow Meta's policies:** Review WhatsApp's commerce and messaging policies before creating templates
3. **Avoid promotional language in Utility templates:** Keep transactional templates informative, not sales-focused
4. **Use proper grammar:** Proofread for spelling and grammatical errors
5. **Include opt-out options:** For marketing templates, provide a way for users to unsubscribe
