## Overview

WhatsApp and Zoho CRM contacts connect automatically through unique phone numbers. When you create or link a contact, all WhatsApp conversations with that number are automatically backed up to your Zoho CRM.

## How Contact Linking Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automatic Phone Number Matching">
    Contacts are linked automatically based on the phone number entered in Zoho CRM's **Phone** or **Mobile** fields. Ensure the number format matches the WhatsApp number format.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Contact via Eazybe">
    You can create a new Zoho contact directly from WhatsApp using the Eazybe extension. The contact will automatically link to the WhatsApp conversation.

  <Step title="Automatic Chat Backup">
    Once a contact is linked, WhatsApp chats with that contact are backed up to Zoho CRM **every 3 minutes**, ensuring your data stays synchronized.
  </Step>
