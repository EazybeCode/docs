title: "6. Why don’t my workflow messages get sent immediately?"

Workflow messages are not sent instantly. It takes about **2 minutes for scheduled messages to be delivered** after they are triggered.


- After scheduling a WhatsApp message via workflow, expect a 2-minute delay before delivery.


- Wait for that period before checking for message delivery.


- If overdue, check cloud connection, scheduled labels, or integration status.
