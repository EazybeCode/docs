An official WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) unlocks powerful features for your business to communicate with customers at scale. This guide explains what a WABA is and what you need before you connect it to Eazybe.

### **What is a WABA? How is it different from connecting my phone?**
When you connect to Eazybe by scanning a QR code, you are using your personal or a standard WhatsApp Business number. A WABA is different - it's an official business line connected directly to Meta's servers.

- **A Phone Number:** You need a phone number that is able to receive OTP for the initial setup.**Important:** If you want to use an existing WhatsApp Business number, you can choose to provide the permissions to share the chat history during initial setup. 
- **Admin Access:** You must be an administrator of the Facebook Business Account to complete the connection process.

Once you have these ready, you can move on to the next step: connecting your account.
