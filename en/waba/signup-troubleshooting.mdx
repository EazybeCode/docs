## Overview

**WhatsApp Coexistence** enables businesses to use the **WhatsApp Business App** and **WhatsApp Business API** with the same phone number. This allows teams to manage conversations in both platforms simultaneously without changing numbers.

<Note>
Since Coexistence is a relatively new Meta capability, onboarding issues during **embedded signup** are common. This guide covers the most frequent problems and their solutions.
</Note>

---

## 1. Phone Number Not Eligible

<Warning>
**Error Message:** "Your phone number isn't eligible to connect to the WhatsApp Business Platform. More activity on the WhatsApp Business App is needed to help determine eligibility."
</Warning>

![Phone number not eligible error](/images/1855687476.png)

### Why This Happens

- Meta requires at least **7 days** of genuine activity on the WhatsApp Business App
- Newly registered numbers or those with minimal chat activity are flagged as ineligible
- Numbers previously tied to a WABA account impact eligibility until cooldown expires

### How to Fix

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the number actively">
    Exchange real customer conversations on the WhatsApp Business App for a minimum of **7 days**. For smoother approval, stay active for **30–60 days**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Avoid re-registering">
    Do not repeatedly delete and re-register the number—this resets activity history and delays eligibility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear old WABA linkage">
    If the number was used with a previous API provider, remove the old WABA setup, re-register in the Business App, and maintain activity for **1–2 months** before retrying.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Country or Region Not Supported

<Warning>
**Error:** The number's country code is not supported for Coexistence.
</Warning>

![Country not supported error](/images/1855689918.png)

### Why This Happens

- Meta has restricted Coexistence for certain regions due to compliance or regulatory limitations
- Numbers from countries such as **Nigeria** and **South Africa** are commonly not compatible

### How to Fix

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use a supported country code">
    Choose a number from an enabled region: **India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, U.S., Hong Kong, or Singapore** (availability may change).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor updates">
    Check Meta's official documentation regularly—support for new regions is expanding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consider interim options">
    If Coexistence isn't available for your region, temporarily rely on the WhatsApp Business App alone.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Number Previously Used with WhatsApp Business API

<Warning>
**Error:** The number is already registered to an existing WhatsApp account or WABA.
</Warning>

![Number previously used error](/images/1855690369.png)

### Why This Happens

- Meta requires a **cooldown period** when a number was previously used with WABA
- Attempting to connect too soon after deleting or moving between providers triggers errors

### How to Fix

<Steps>
  <Step title="Delete the old WABA">
    Log into your previous provider's portal (or Business Manager) and fully remove the WABA configuration for that number.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-register in the Business App">
    Set up the same number in the WhatsApp Business App and use it actively for **1–2 months**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Do not rush re-integration">
    Avoid reconnecting to the API immediately—retrying during cooldown causes repeated failures.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Chat Sync Delays or Failures

<Info>
**Symptom:** Long delays (several hours) for chat history and contacts to appear, or sync processes that fail midway.
</Info>

### Why This Happens

- Very large chat histories and contact lists significantly increase sync time
- Unstable internet or a closed/inactive app during sync interrupts the process

### How to Fix

<Steps>
  <Step title="Keep phone and app active">
    Leave your phone unlocked with the WhatsApp Business App open during sync.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use a stable connection">
    Connect to reliable Wi-Fi or strong mobile data before starting sync.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Allow enough time">
    For heavy histories, expect **4–6 hours or more**. Avoid interrupting the process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart if needed">
    If sync appears stuck, rescan the QR code after confirming app version **2.24.17 or later**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 5. QR Code Not Appearing or Not Scanning

<Info>
**Symptom:** The QR code doesn't render on screen or cannot be scanned from the app.
</Info>

### Why This Happens

- The WhatsApp Business App is outdated and doesn't support Coexistence
- Incorrect signup flow navigation
- Device camera issues or temporary Meta service problems

### How to Fix

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update your app">
    Confirm the WhatsApp Business App is on version **2.24.17 or newer**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow the correct menu path">
    Navigate to **Settings → WhatsApp → Sign Up with Facebook** in the app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check camera and lighting">
    Clean the camera lens, use good lighting, and avoid reflections or glare.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retry after some time">
    Close both the app and browser, wait a few minutes, then try again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reinstall as last resort">
    If persistent, uninstall and reinstall the WhatsApp Business App.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Facebook Page Linking Issues

<Info>
**Symptom:** Errors or incomplete flows when linking WhatsApp to a Facebook Page during onboarding.
</Info>

### Why This Happens

- No Facebook Page or Meta Business Account is configured
- The logged-in user lacks admin access to the Page or Business Manager
- Account-level or regional restrictions block the linking step

### How to Fix

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Facebook Page">
    If you don't have one, create or connect a Page from **Business Tools → Facebook & Instagram** in the app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm admin permissions">
    Ensure you're signed in with a Meta account that has **admin rights** on both the Page and Business Account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Meta Business Account setup">
    During embedded signup, select or create a Meta Business Account and fill in all required business details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Cannot Disable Coexistence

<Info>
**Symptom:** No visible toggle in your API provider's platform to turn off Coexistence.
</Info>

### Why This Happens

- Coexistence is controlled from the WhatsApp Business App side—the Cloud API interface doesn't expose a direct "disable" option

### How to Fix

<Steps>
  <Step title="Disconnect via the app">
    In the WhatsApp Business App, go to **Settings → Account → Business Platform** and use the **Disconnect** option.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Avoid uninstalling">
    Don't uninstall the app to disable Coexistence—this complicates future onboarding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contact support">
    If you cannot see the disconnect option, contact your provider or Meta support.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 8. Unsupported Companion Devices

<Info>
**Symptom:** Messages from certain companion devices (e.g., wearables) are missing from API conversations.
</Info>

### Why This Happens

- Only **WhatsApp Web** and official desktop apps are supported in Coexistence
- Messages from unsupported companions are delivered to end users but not synced to the Cloud API

### How to Fix

<Steps>
  <Step title="Re-link to supported devices">
    Use **WhatsApp Web** or the official **WhatsApp desktop app for Mac/Windows**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch for placeholders">
    Some solutions show warnings when messages come from unsupported devices.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track changes">
    Monitor product updates—Meta is gradually adding support for additional device types.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 9. Business Name Locked After Onboarding

<Info>
**Symptom:** Unable to modify your business name once Coexistence is active.
</Info>

### Why This Happens

- Meta enforces a single, consistent business identity across the WhatsApp Business App and API to prevent misuse

### How to Fix

<Steps>
  <Step title="Finalize before onboarding">
    Confirm the correct business name in both the app and Meta Business Manager **before** starting signup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request changes via support">
    If you must update the name after onboarding, raise a request through Meta support or your provider. Approvals are not guaranteed.
  </Step>
</Steps>
