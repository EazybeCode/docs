## Unreplied Chats Detection

Eazybe's AI Agent automatically scans your team's WhatsApp conversations to identify unreplied chats and prioritize them by urgency.

### How It Works

The AI agent analyzes every conversation and applies priority labels:

| Priority | Label | Indicators |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **Critical** | 🔴 Red | Keywords like "urgent", "cancel", "refund", "complaint", high-value customers |
| **Non-Critical** | Standard | Regular inquiries without urgency signals |

### Step 1: Open Team Inbox

1. Log in to the Eazybe workspace
2. Navigate to **Team Inbox** from the sidebar
3. Click on **Unreplied** filter

### Step 2: Identify Critical Chats

Critical chats display a **red label** indicating high priority:

- Complaints and escalations
- Billing and payment issues
- Order cancellations
- High-value customer alerts

### Step 3: Filter Your View

Use built-in filters to focus your workload:

- **All chats** - View everything
- **Only critical** - Focus on urgent issues
- **Only non-critical** - Handle routine inquiries

### AI Detection Keywords

The AI looks for urgency indicators like:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Complaints">
    - urgent
    - immediately
    - escalate
    - manager
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cancellation">
    - cancel
    - refund
    - return
    - money back
  </Card>
  <Card title="Issues">
    - not working
    - problem
    - broken
    - failed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Admin Notifications

Administrators receive automated WhatsApp summaries every 3 hours with:
- Count of unreplied chats
- Critical vs non-critical breakdown
- Team member assignments

<Warning>
Critical chats left unreplied for more than 4 hours trigger escalation alerts to admins.
</Warning>
