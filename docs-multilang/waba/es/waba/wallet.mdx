## How Billing Works

WhatsApp API messages are charged per message delivered. Eazybe uses a **prepaid wallet system**:

1. Add funds to your Eazybe wallet
2. Send messages (broadcasts, templates)
3. Charges deduct automatically from your balance
4. Get notifications when balance is low

<Info>
**Starter Credits:** Every new business connecting WABA receives **₹100 or $1 free** credits to get started!
