There are two ways to verify that your **EazyBe Cloud** is successfully connected:

- 
#### Check the Cloud Icon
In the EazyBe WhatsApp extension, look for the cloud icon. If it’s green, your cloud is connected.

- 
#### Check Your Workspace
In the workspace, if the **status** next to your account name shows "**Connected**," your cloud has been successfully linked.
