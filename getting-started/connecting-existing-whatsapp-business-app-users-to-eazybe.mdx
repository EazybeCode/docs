### What is Coexistence?
WhatsApp Business App Coexistence allows your business to use the **same WhatsApp number** with both the **WhatsApp Business App** and the **WhatsApp Cloud API simultaneously**. This means you can keep the convenience of the mobile app for day-to-day conversations while unlocking advanced automation, broadcasts, and CRM integration through Eazybe’s platform.
