The Key Details in the Lead Activity are:


- **Lead Score:** This is a cumulative score based on all the activities that a lead performs within the extension. It reflects how engaged a lead is with the LeadSquared. This score is calculated by assigning points to different lead activities within the application, helping you to understand their level of engagement. 


- **Engagement Score:** Engagement scores help you identify which leads are most likely to buy your products or services. These metrics offer insights into the activities leads are performing on your user interface, giving you an idea of their interests and behavior.


- **Lead Properties:** The Lead Properties displays key information such as the lead owner, lead source and lead age—how long the lead has been using your services.
