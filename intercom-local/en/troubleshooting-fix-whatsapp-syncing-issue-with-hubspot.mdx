Your WhatsApp conversations aren't syncing with HubSpot ? You're moving your conversations forward, but the backup isn't getting stored on HubSpot. Worried about losing your chats? Don't worry! This troubleshooting guide will help you check that everything is set up correctly for syncing.
​

### 
Grant Access
EazyBe asks for specific permissions when integrating with HubSpot. Ensure that these permissions are granted, as they are crucial for storing WhatsApp conversations via the EazyBe WhatsApp Extension. Make sure your super-admin has provided access to the **File and App Marketplace permissions**. If not, reach out to your super-admin to grant these permissions.

### 
WhatsApp Activity enabled in HubSpot

- Open any **HubSpot contact** **page,** either using EazyBe's 'View Contact on HubSpot' button or by navigating to the HubSpot contacts page.
- On the HubSpot page, click and expand **Filter activity**.
- Ensure the checkbox next to **WhatsApp Activity** under the **Communication section** is checked. If unchecked, WhatsApp conversations won't appear as they are stored under this section.

  

### HubSpot permissions

- Click on the **Settings** icon in HubSpot.

  

- Under **Account Management**, click on **Users & Teams**.

  

- Click **Edit** **permissions** next to the username for which you want to enable permissions for.

  

- If you don't have necessary permissions, contact your super-admin to grant the required access and ask them to give you the permissions for **App marketplace** and **files**.

  

​**Note**: A super-admin has an access to all the permissions.

### Label Sync Permissions
If you've created a label and added contacts to it, but the conversations aren't being backed up, follow these steps:

- Click on the **Backup and Sync** button on the right sidebar.

  

- Verify the label settings to ensure it is set to **Sync** and not **Don't Sync**. If it is set to **Don't Sync**, the chats for contacts within that label will not be backed up.
If you want the chats to be synced, click on the **Sync** button. Alternatively, you can remove certain contacts from the label and create a new label for the contacts you wish to sync.
