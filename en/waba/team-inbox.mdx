The Team Inbox serves as your collaborative hub for all customer conversations on your WABA number. This guide explains how messaging works based on your specific setup.

## Understanding Your Messaging Setup

Your experience in the Team Inbox depends on how you've configured your WhatsApp integration:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Extension-Only User" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Uses Chrome extension to sync WhatsApp conversations without WABA connection
  </Card>
  <Card title="WABA-Only User" icon="cloud">
    Uses Team Inbox as the primary interface for official WhatsApp Business API
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extension + WABA User" icon="layer-group">
    Operates both channels simultaneously for maximum flexibility
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## For Extension-Only Users

Your experience in the Team Inbox remains unchanged. Key features include:

- Conversations sync directly from WhatsApp Web
- You can send and receive any type of message (text, media, etc.) at any time without restrictions

## Key Concepts for WABA-Powered Messaging

### The 24-Hour Customer Service Window

WhatsApp enforces specific messaging windows that determine how you can communicate with customers:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Window OPEN" icon="clock">
    When a customer messages you, a 24-hour window opens. The Team Inbox displays the time remaining (e.g., "15h 30m"). During this window, free-form messaging is allowed.

    ![Window Open Status](/images/1589300920.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Window CLOSED" icon="lock">
    After 24 hours without customer interaction, the window closes. The display shows "This chat is resolved and expired." Only template messages are permitted.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### The Dynamic Message Composer

The message input area adapts automatically based on the window status:

- **Open window:** Standard free-form composer for unrestricted messaging
- **Closed window:** "Send Template" button replaces the composer

### Sending Message Templates

When the messaging window is closed, follow these steps to send a template:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Send Template">
    Click the **Send Template** button in the message composer area.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browse Templates">
    A pop-up appears displaying your approved templates list.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Template Details">
    View each template's name, category, and language to select the appropriate one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Template">
    Select your desired template to send it to the customer.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Messaging Works for Your Specific Setup

### Scenario A: WABA-Only User

<Info>
As a WABA-only user, all your messaging follows WhatsApp Business API rules.
</Info>

- **Starting conversations:** Requires selecting a Message Template
- **Replying to customers:** Depends on window status—free-form if open, templates only if closed

### Scenario B: Dual User (Extension + WABA)

#### Using Different Numbers

When your extension and WABA use different phone numbers:

- Team Inbox separates conversations by number filter
- **Extension-synced chats:** Message freely anytime without restrictions
- **WABA chats:** Follow WABA rules (24-hour window, templates)
- **New chats:** Prompt appears to choose contact and select sending number

#### Using the Same Number

When both channels share the same phone number:

<Warning>
**WABA is Default:** Any message you send from the Team Inbox will default to using the WABA (Cloud API) channel. WABA rules apply automatically.
</Warning>

- Conversations merge into single threads
- All messages follow WABA messaging rules

## WABA Message Statuses and Errors

Understanding message status indicators helps you track delivery:

| Status | Indicator | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Sent** | One grey tick | Message sent to WhatsApp servers |
| **Delivered** | Two grey ticks | Message delivered to recipient's device |
| **Read** | Two blue ticks | Recipient has read the message |
| **Failed** | Red exclamation mark | Message failed to send |
