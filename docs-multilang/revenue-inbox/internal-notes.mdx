### Manage Note

Once, the note is created, you can **view**, **edit** or **delete** the Note whenever needed. You can also create a new note by clicking on the **Add Note** button and repeating the same process again. This allows you to easily keep track of multiple follow-up notes for each contact, ensuring that all important details are captured for future reference.
