title: "7. Why are my workflow messages getting sent multiple times?"

This usually happens when the same account is active on more than one device. 


- Check if the **same WhatsApp number** is logged in with your **Eazybe account** on multiple devices.


- Log out from the extra devices and keep only one active session to avoid duplicate messages.
