## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I edit the phone number?">
    Phone numbers are locked to prevent accidental changes that would break the WhatsApp-HubSpot link. The number comes directly from WhatsApp.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I create contacts in bulk?">
    The Mini-CRM is designed for individual contact creation during conversations. For bulk imports, use HubSpot's native import feature.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if a contact already exists?">
    Eazybe automatically matches contacts by phone number. If a match is found, the existing contact is displayed instead of the create option.
