Dynamic WhatsApp Labels allow you to automatically organize your WhatsApp contacts based on real-time HubSpot CRM data. Once set up, these labels are created and updated automatically, giving your team immediate visibility into key customer segments directly within WhatsApp—without any manual effort.

This feature ensures that your WhatsApp communication stays aligned with the most current customer information in HubSpot.

## **About Dynamic Labels**

Dynamic Labels are WhatsApp labels generated and maintained based on rules you define using HubSpot properties. When a contact in HubSpot matches the criteria you specify, they are automatically added to the corresponding WhatsApp label. If a contact no longer meets the criteria, they are removed.

This ensures all labels remain accurate and up to date.

## **Creating a Dynamic Label**
