Yes, you can stop syncing for particular contacts:

- **Unlink the contact** if you no longer want it to appear on HubSpot.
- If you want the contact to remain on HubSpot but wish to stop chat backups for certain contacts, follow these steps:

Create a **new label**.

  

- Add the contacts for which you want to stop syncing under this label.

  

- Go to **Backup and Sync** in the right sidebar.

  

- Click on the **Don't Sync** button next to the label that includes the contacts you want to stop syncing.
