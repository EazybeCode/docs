WhatsApp and Bitrix contacts are linked automatically through the unique phone number added in the Bitrix **Phone Number** or **Mobile** field. You can also create a new contact directly from WhatsApp using Eazybe, or link an existing contact to a phone number in WhatsApp.

## How Contact Linking Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automatic Linking via Phone Number">
    When you create a new Bitrix contact through the Eazybe WhatsApp extension, the contact is **automatically linked** to Bitrix using the phone number as the unique identifier.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Chat Backup Activation">
    Once linked, your WhatsApp chats with that contact are **backed up to Bitrix every 3 minutes**, ensuring real-time sync and data accuracy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync Status Tracking">
    The **last sync time** for each contact is updated in the Eazybe workspace, providing an up-to-date view of your conversation backup status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Gets Synced

Once linked, the **Contact Card** of the respective contact appears in Eazybe's mini-CRM view. The following data is backed up to Bitrix:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="1:1 Chats" icon="message">
    All individual WhatsApp conversations with the linked contact
  </Card>
  <Card title="Group Chats" icon="users">
    Group chats associated with the contact are also backed up
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The backed-up chats are visible on the **Contact's page** in Bitrix.

<Note>
Both individual and group chats associated with the contact will be backed up and visible in the Bitrix Contact's page.
