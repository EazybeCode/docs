## Overview

WhatsApp and HubSpot contacts are linked automatically through the unique phone number in the HubSpot phone field. After integrating HubSpot with the Eazybe WhatsApp extension, you can view and manage your HubSpot contacts directly through the WhatsApp interface.

<Note>
Contacts are matched using the phone number as the unique identifier. Ensure your HubSpot contacts have accurate phone numbers to enable automatic linking.

## How Contact Linking Works

### Automatic Linking

When you integrate HubSpot with Eazybe, the system automatically links contacts based on their phone numbers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Phone Number Matching">
    The Eazybe extension scans the WhatsApp contact's phone number and matches it with the phone field in your HubSpot contacts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Contact Display">
    Once matched, the HubSpot contact information becomes visible within the WhatsApp extension interface.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Unified Management">
    You can now view contact details, deals, tasks, and notes directly from WhatsApp without switching to HubSpot.
  </Step>
</Steps>
