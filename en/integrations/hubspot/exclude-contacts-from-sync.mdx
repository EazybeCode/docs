title: "Exclude Contacts from Sync"
description: "Learn how to stop chat synchronization for specific contacts in your HubSpot integration"
---

## Overview

When you have many HubSpot-connected contacts, you may not want all conversations to sync automatically. Eazybe provides a label-based system that allows you to selectively exclude specific contacts from chat backup synchronization.

<Note>
This feature is useful for excluding personal contacts, internal team chats, or any conversations you don't want recorded in HubSpot.
</Note>

---

## How It Works

Eazybe uses a **label-based exclusion system**. You create a shared label, add contacts you want to exclude, and then disable sync for that entire label. This approach makes it easy to manage multiple contacts at once.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Shared Label">
    First, create a shared label within the Eazybe WhatsApp extension. Add all the contacts you **do not want** chat backups to sync with HubSpot under this label.

    <Tip>
    Name your label something descriptive like "No Sync" or "Exclude from Backup" for easy identification.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Backup and Sync Settings">
    Click the **Backup and Sync** icon in the WhatsApp extension's right sidebar. In the resulting window, select the **HubSpot** button to access HubSpot-specific sync settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disable Sync for the Label">
    Locate the label containing the contacts you want to exclude. Click the **Don't Sync** button beside the label to disable synchronization for all contacts in that label.

    <Check>
    Chat synchronization is now disabled for all contacts in this label!
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Re-enabling Sync

If you need to restore synchronization for previously excluded contacts:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Sync for the Label">
    Navigate back to the Backup and Sync settings, find your excluded label, and click the **Sync** button to restore synchronization.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Selective Re-enabling">
    To selectively enable sync for specific contacts only:

    1. Remove those contacts from the excluded label
    2. Keep other contacts in the label to maintain their exclusion
    3. The removed contacts will automatically resume syncing
  </Step>
</Steps>
