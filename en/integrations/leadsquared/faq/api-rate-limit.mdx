description: "Understanding the API limit exceeded toast and rate limits when working with LeadSquared"
---

If you're seeing a toast notification about API limit being exceeded, this article explains the rate limits in place when working with the LeadSquared integration.

## Rate Limit Information

<Warning>
  There is a rate limit of **5 API calls per second** when working with the LeadSquared integration.
</Warning>

The EazyBe system has been optimized to handle this constraint efficiently. However, when you receive a toast notification about API limits, it indicates that the 5 calls-per-second threshold has been exceeded.

## Why This Happens

The API rate limit notification may appear when:

- Multiple WhatsApp conversations are being synced simultaneously
- Rapid actions are being performed in the Mini-CRM panel
- Several team members are actively using the integration at the same time

<Info>
  This is a limitation imposed by LeadSquared's API, not by EazyBe. The rate limit helps ensure stable service for all users.
</Info>

## What To Do

<Tip>
  If you frequently encounter the API limit notification:
  - Wait a few seconds before retrying your action
  - Space out your activities when performing multiple operations
  - The system will automatically retry failed requests when the limit resets
</Tip>
