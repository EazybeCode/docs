## Funnels

Funnels help you track leads through your sales pipeline with defined stages.

### Creating a Funnel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Label">
    Click **Add Label** in the sidebar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Funnel">
    Choose **Funnel** instead of Label
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Stages">
    Add your pipeline stages in order:
    - New Lead
    - Contacted
    - Qualified
    - Proposal Sent
    - Won/Lost
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Visibility">
    Choose Personal or Shared
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Moving Contacts Through Stages

1. Open the conversation
2. Click the funnel icon in sidebar
3. Select the new stage
4. Contact moves to that stage (and leaves previous)

### Key Difference from Labels

<Warning>
A contact can only be in **one funnel stage** at a time. Moving to a new stage removes them from the previous stage.
</Warning>

### Example Sales Funnel

```
📊 Sales Pipeline
   1️⃣ New Lead
   2️⃣ Contacted
   3️⃣ Discovery Call
   4️⃣ Proposal Sent
   5️⃣ Negotiation
   6️⃣ Closed Won ✅
   7️⃣ Closed Lost ❌
```

### Viewing Funnel Analytics

In the Team Inbox:
1. Click on your funnel name
2. See contacts in each stage
3. View conversion rates between stages
4. Identify bottlenecks in your pipeline

<Info>
Funnels work great with [Dynamic Labels](/integrations/hubspot/dynamic-labels) to sync with your CRM pipeline stages.
