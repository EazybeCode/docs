## **1. Introduction**

WhatsApp Coexistence is a Meta-provided solution that allows businesses to connect their active WhatsApp Business App phone number to the WhatsApp Cloud API — without losing chats, contacts, or requiring re-registration of the number.

**This guide covers:**

- What Coex is
- Prerequisites before onboarding
- Step-by-step setup
- Common issues & troubleshooting
- FAQs for beginners
- Best practices after onboarding

## **2. Product Overview — What is WhatsApp Coexistence?**

**Coex allows businesses to:**

- Connect the WhatsApp Business App to the Cloud API
- Continue using the Business App normally
- Sync messages & contacts into a Cloud API platform
- Avoid re-registering the number
- Avoid losing the Verified badge (if applicable)

## **Benefits of WhatsApp Business App Coexistence**

- Use the same phone number across both the WhatsApp Business App and API.
- Synchronise messages and contacts in real-time: Messages sent/received through the app appear in the API inbox and vice versa.
- Combine human interaction with automation: Use the mobile app for 1-to-1 chats, and API for scalable Broadcast messaging and Workflows.
- Preserve chat history and contacts without data loss.
- Maintain access to your familiar WhatsApp Business App interface.

**This is the safest method to migrate to Cloud API without losing data.**

## 
**Troubleshooting**

### **Issue 1: Integration Failed**

Common reasons:

- Old WhatsApp version
- Number inactivity
- Meta restrictions
- No Facebook Page admin access

**Solution: Use another number that has active WhatsApp Business usage + no past violations.**

### **Issue 2: Chat History Did Not Import**

**If chat import fails:**

- Open WhatsApp Business App.
- Go to: Settings → Business Tools → WhatsApp Business Platform
- Tap Disconnect.
- Restart Coex onboarding.

**If you manually skipped history import initially, you must fully offboard and onboard again; it may back up all the chats, sometimes it does not get back up if you chose the wrong option while signing up for the first time and the old chats on your account changed/deleted.**

## **Issue 3: Number Has Meta Restrictions**

**Symptoms:**

- Coex onboarding fails instantly
- QR code doesn’t complete
- No “Connect to Business Platform” message appears

**Solution: Use a new number that has:**

- Zero policy issues
- Frequent legitimate WA Business activity
