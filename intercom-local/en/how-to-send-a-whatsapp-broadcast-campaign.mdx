With a connected WABA, funded Eazybe Wallet and an approved Message Template, you're ready to send a broadcast campaign to your customers.

**Starter Credits:** Every new business (organisation) connecting WABA for the first time receives **₹100 or $1 free **credits in their wallet from Eazybe to get started!

### **Sending Your First Broadcast**

- **Navigate to Broadcasts:** From the main menu, select **Broadcasts**.

  

​**From extension**:

  

- **Create New Broadcast:** Click the **"Create Broadcast"** button.

- **Name Your Broadcast:** Give your campaign a clear, internal name (e.g., "June Newsletter 2025").

  

- **Select Your Template:** Choose one of your **Approved** Message Templates from the dropdown list.

- **Upload Your Contacts:**

Click **"Upload CSV"** and select a file from your computer.
Your CSV file must contain a "Phone" column with numbers in international format (e.g., `91xxxxxxxxxx`).

  

- **Select the contacts:** Select the contacts from the imported CSV to whom you wish to send.

  

- **Select label (extension):** If you're sending the broadcast from the extension, you can select the label which has the contacts tagged to whom you wish to send the broadcast. Ensure that only individual contacts are labelled here, and not groups.

  

​**From extension:**

  

- **Launch Your Broadcast:** Click **"Send Broadcast"**.

  

​**From extension:**

  

That's it! You can track the performance of your campaign, including how many messages were sent, delivered, and read, directly from the Broadcast dashboard.
