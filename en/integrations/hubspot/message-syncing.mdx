## Overview

Eazybe automatically syncs your WhatsApp conversations with HubSpot contacts, ensuring all your customer communications are backed up and accessible within your CRM. This guide explains how message syncing works and how to manage your sync settings.

<Note>
Message syncing only occurs for chats with contacts that exist in your HubSpot CRM. Ensure your contacts are properly linked for automatic backup.
</Note>

## Automatic Sync

## Initial Integration

Upon first integrating HubSpot with Eazybe, the system automatically provides a chat backup spanning **the past 3 days**. This ensures you have recent conversation history immediately available in HubSpot.

<Info>
The 3-day historical backup only occurs once during initial setup. After that, only new messages sync at 3-minute intervals.
</Info>

## Activity Logging

WhatsApp chats are preserved in the **WhatsApp Activity** object within HubSpot's activity section.

## Attachments Backup

Attachments sync alongside messages within HubSpot's WhatsApp activity. The system combines text and attachment links in a unified format.

### How Attachments Work

- **Combined Format** — Text messages and attachments appear together in the activity log
- **Clickable Links** — Click attachment links to view images, documents, and other files
- **Complete History** — All media shared in conversations is preserved and accessible

<Tip>
Attachments are stored securely and can be accessed anytime through the activity links in HubSpot.
</Tip>

## Sync Management

### Selective Sync Settings

You can manage which conversations sync to HubSpot through the Mini-CRM view:

1. Open the HubSpot Mini-CRM panel in the Eazybe extension
2. Navigate to Sync settings
3. Enable or disable sync for specific contacts

<Warning>
Disabling sync for a contact will stop new messages from backing up, but previously synced messages will remain in HubSpot.
</Warning>
