Bulk Messaging (Broadcast) lets you send the same message to multiple contacts simultaneously. Unlike WhatsApp's native broadcast feature, Eazybe's bulk messaging integrates with your labels and quick replies for targeted, personalized outreach.

<Warning>
**Use Responsibly:** Excessive bulk messaging may violate WhatsApp's terms of service and could result in your number being banned. Always read the disclaimer before sending and only contact people who have opted in.
</Warning>

## Targeting with Labels

Labels help you segment your contacts for targeted messaging:

| Label Example | Use Case | Message Type |
|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **Hot Leads** | Ready-to-buy prospects | Special offers, demos |
| **New Customers** | Recent purchasers | Onboarding, welcome |
| **Pending Payment** | Awaiting payment | Reminders, payment links |
| **VIP Clients** | High-value customers | Exclusive offers, early access |
| **Inactive** | Haven't engaged in 30+ days | Re-engagement campaigns |
| **Event Attendees** | Registered for event | Event reminders, updates |

## Extension vs WABA Broadcasting

| Feature | Extension Broadcast | WABA Broadcast |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Volume** | Limited (use carefully) | Thousands of messages |
| **Requires laptop** | Yes (browser must be open) | No (cloud-based) |
| **Message type** | Quick Replies | Meta-approved templates |
| **Risk level** | Higher (personal number) | Lower (official API) |
| **Cost** | Free (within plan) | Per-message pricing |
| **Best for** | Small batches, warm contacts | Large-scale campaigns |

<Info>
For high-volume broadcasting without risking your personal number, consider using [WABA Broadcasting](/waba/broadcasting/overview) which uses Meta's official WhatsApp Business API.

## Sending Limits & Safety

### Recommended Limits
- **New numbers:** Max 50 messages/day for first week
- **Established numbers:** Max 200 messages/day
- **With WABA:** Based on quality rating (up to unlimited)

### Safety Tips
1. **Start small** — Test with 10-20 contacts first
2. **Space out messages** — Don't send all at once
3. **Monitor responses** — Watch for blocks or reports
4. **Use opt-in lists only** — Never message cold contacts in bulk

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many messages can I send at once?">
    While there's no hard limit in the Extension, we recommend limiting bulk messages to 50-100 per batch for new numbers, and no more than 200 per day for established numbers. For larger campaigns, use WABA.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will recipients see it as a broadcast?">
    No, each message is sent as an individual chat, not a WhatsApp broadcast list. Recipients see it as a direct message from you.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I include attachments in bulk messages?">
    Yes, if your Quick Reply includes an attachment, it will be sent to all recipients. Keep file sizes under 20MB.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if someone blocks me?">
    The message won't be delivered to that contact. Monitor your block rate—if more than 2-3% of recipients block you, pause your campaigns and review your approach.
