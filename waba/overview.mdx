## Key Capabilities

### 1. Template Messages

Pre-approved message formats for reaching customers outside the 24-hour window:

- **Marketing:** Promotions, offers, announcements
- **Utility:** Order updates, shipping notifications, appointment reminders
- **Authentication:** OTPs, verification codes

### 2. 24-Hour Messaging Window

When a customer messages you, a **24-hour service window** opens where you can send any message (including free-form text) without template restrictions. After 24 hours, you must use an approved template to re-engage.

### 3. Coexistence Mode

Keep using your **WhatsApp Business App** on your phone while also connecting to the API. Messages sync between both platforms in real-time.
