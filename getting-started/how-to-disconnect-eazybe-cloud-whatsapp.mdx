There are two ways to disconnect cloud from the EazyBe WhatsApp Extension. The main drawback is that you will no longer be able to sync chats or schedule messages while your laptop is closed. 


- 
#### Disconnect via the EazyBe Workspace

If cloud is connected, you can disconnect it by clicking the **Stop Connection **button next to the account for which you want to disconnect Cloud.
