title: "1. Why are my workflow messages not getting scheduled?"
description: ""

To ensure workflow messages are scheduled successfully, the **Email ID registered on your HubSpot account and your Eazybe account must be the same**.

- Install Eazybe Chrome extension from the official store.
- Integrate with HubSpot via Eazybe by following the in-app prompts and granting permissions.
- Check for successful linkage by seeing Eazybe-enabled features in HubSpot.

  

- Log in to your HubSpot account and note your registered email.
- Open Eazybe, go to Account Settings, and verify registered email matches HubSpot.
- If needed, update your email in HubSpot or Eazybe so they are identical before setting up workflows.
