| 1:1 Chats   | Up to 6 months           |

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/1908050113-image.png" alt="Import selection screen" />
</Frame>

<Accordion title="Why can't group chats be imported?">
  WhatsApp's Coexistence feature only supports importing direct (1:1)
  conversations. Group chats remain accessible through the WhatsApp Business App
  but are not migrated to the Cloud API. This is a Meta limitation, not an
  Eazybe restriction.
</Accordion>

  <Step title="Verify Account">
    Confirm your account details are correct in the final review screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Processing">

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Integration Failed">
**Common Causes:**
- WhatsApp Business App version is outdated (must be 2.24.17+)
- Phone number has been inactive for too long
- Number has Meta policy restrictions or violations
- Missing Facebook Business Page admin access

**Solution:** Use a number with active WhatsApp Business usage and zero policy violations. Update your app to the latest version and verify your Facebook admin permissions.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Chat History Import Failed">
**How to Resolve:**
1. Open your **WhatsApp Business App**
2. Go to **Settings → Business Tools → WhatsApp Business Platform**
3. Tap **Disconnect**
4. Wait 5 minutes
5. Restart the Coexistence onboarding process from the beginning

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/1908203806-image.png"
    alt="Disconnect option in WhatsApp Business settings"
  />
</Frame>

<Warning>
Disconnecting will only remove the API connection. Your chats and contacts remain safe in the app.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Meta Restrictions Error">
**Symptoms:**
- Instant failure during connection
- QR code doesn't fully load
- No verification message received

**Solution:** This indicates your number has underlying restrictions from Meta. You'll need to use a **different phone number** with:

- Zero policy violations
- Legitimate, active business usage
- No previous API connections

</Accordion>
