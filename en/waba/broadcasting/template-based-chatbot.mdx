# Template-Based Chatbot

Orchestrate fully automated, interactive WhatsApp journeys directly within your HubSpot Workflows. This feature transforms static message templates into dynamic, two-way conversations. By leveraging **Quick Reply buttons**, you can build intelligent chatbots that engage leads, qualify prospects, and handle support queries 24/7—without writing a single line of code.

Using Eazybe's advanced **"Send WhatsApp & Wait for Reply"** action, your HubSpot workflows pause to listen for customer inputs, then instantly route them down specific branches based on which button they clicked. It's the ultimate tool for turning WhatsApp into an always-on engine for sales and support.

## Why the Template-Based Chatbot Matters

In an era of instant gratification, customers expect immediate answers. This feature bridges the gap between manual chatting and complex custom coding. It allows scaling businesses to automate repetitive conversations while keeping all data synchronized inside HubSpot, ensuring that your human agents only step in when high-value interactions occur.

### Key Benefits
