If your WhatsApp conversations are not being backed up in Bitrix, follow this troubleshooting guide to verify your setup is configured correctly.

## Check Your Account

Before troubleshooting further, verify these essential requirements:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify EazyBe Installation">
    Confirm that EazyBe is properly installed through Bitrix's Apps Marketplace. The app should be listed in your installed applications.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate Active Subscriptions">
    Ensure that both your Bitrix and EazyBe subscriptions are active and not expired. Inactive subscriptions will prevent syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Grant Access

When integrating EazyBe with Bitrix, you must authorize specific permissions. These permissions are essential for storing WhatsApp conversations via the EazyBe extension.

<Note>
Without proper permissions granted, EazyBe cannot sync your WhatsApp chats to Bitrix. Make sure all requested permissions are approved during the integration setup.
</Note>

## Common Issues Checklist

If syncing still isn't working after verifying the above:

- **Browser extension disabled** - Ensure the EazyBe extension is enabled in your browser
- **WhatsApp Web not active** - Keep WhatsApp Web open for syncing to occur
- **Contact not linked** - Only conversations with linked Bitrix contacts will sync
- **Network issues** - Check your internet connection stability

<Tip>
Syncing occurs automatically every 3 minutes for linked contacts. If you just connected, wait a few minutes for the initial sync to complete.
</Tip>
