## Labels vs Funnels

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Labels" icon="tag">
    - Categorize contacts with sub-labels
    - Contacts can have multiple labels
    - Great for organizing by type, source, or category
  </Card>
  <Card title="Funnels" icon="filter">
    - Feature sequential stages
    - Contacts move through stages one at a time
    - Only one stage per contact at a time
    - Ideal for sales pipelines or support workflows
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Visibility Options

| Visibility | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Personal** | Only you can see and access the label/funnel |
| **Shared** | Your entire team or organization can access it |

<Tip>
  Use shared labels and funnels for team collaboration, and personal ones for your individual workflow organization.
