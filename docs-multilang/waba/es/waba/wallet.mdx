## How Billing Works

Eazybe uses a **prepaid wallet system** for WABA messaging:

1. Add funds to your Eazybe wallet
2. Send broadcasts using approved templates
3. Message costs are deducted from your balance
4. Top up when balance runs low

<Info>
**Starter Credits:** Every new business connecting WABA for the first time receives **$1 USD** or **₹100 INR** free credits to get started!
</Info>

## Message Costs

Costs vary by:
- **Template category** (Marketing, Utility, Authentication)
- **Recipient's country**
- **Message direction** (outbound templates cost, service messages are free)

See [Pricing](/waba/pricing) for detailed rates by country.

## Understanding Charges

| Type | When Charged | Cost |
|------|--------------|------|
| **Marketing Template** | When broadcast sent | Varies by country |
| **Utility Template** | When broadcast sent | Lower than marketing |
| **Authentication Template** | When OTP sent | Lowest rate |
| **Service Message** | Within 24hr window | FREE |

<Tip>
**Save Money:** Use Utility templates for transactional messages - they're significantly cheaper than Marketing templates and often have the same impact.
