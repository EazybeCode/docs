This guide explains how to view and recharge your Eazybe Wallet balance to ensure uninterrupted WhatsApp broadcast campaigns.

## How the Eazybe Wallet Works

All charges for sending WhatsApp broadcasts are managed through the Eazybe Wallet. Your wallet balance is deducted each time you send broadcast messages.

<Info>
Every new business (organization) connecting WABA for the first time receives **₹100 or $1 in free credits** to get started!
</Info>

Once your free credits are exhausted, you'll need to add funds to continue sending broadcasts.
