## The Problem

Managers have no visibility into WhatsApp:
- Who's responding? Who's ignoring leads?
- How fast are reps replying?
- Which reps close more deals via WhatsApp?
- Where are conversations getting stuck?

| **First Response** | < 5 min | Leads expect instant replies |
| **Average Response** | < 15 min | Keeps conversations moving |
| **Business Hours** | < 2 min | Prioritize during work time |

### Conversation Volume

## Using Data for Coaching

### Identify Improvement Areas

| Observation | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Rep A has slow response times | Review workload, provide time management training |
| Rep B has low close rate | Review conversation quality, sales training |
| Peak volume at 2pm | Ensure coverage during peak times |

### Weekly Review Template

Use this template for weekly team reviews:

```markdown
## WhatsApp Performance Review - Week of [DATE]

### Team Summary
- Total conversations: X
- Average response time: X min
- Conversations closed: X%

### Top Performers
1. [Rep Name] - X conversations, X min avg response
2. [Rep Name] - X conversations, X min avg response

### Areas for Improvement
- [Issue identified]
- [Action plan]

### Goals for Next Week
- Reduce avg response time to X min
- Close X% of open conversations
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set realistic targets">
    Start with achievable goals (e.g., < 15 min response) and tighten over time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Focus on trends, not snapshots">
    One bad day doesn't mean a rep is underperforming. Look at weekly/monthly trends.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use data for coaching, not punishment">
    Frame metrics as improvement opportunities, not gotcha moments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consider context">
    A rep handling complex enterprise deals will have different metrics than one handling quick support queries.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
