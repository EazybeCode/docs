description: "Understand where your WhatsApp chat data is backed up when using Eazybe with HubSpot integration"
---

## Overview

Eazybe prioritizes your privacy by ensuring WhatsApp chat data is **never stored on Eazybe's servers**. Instead, data either syncs directly with your CRM system or backs up to Google Drive for Team Inbox users.

<Note>
Eazybe acts as a secure data connector — it facilitates the transfer of your chat data but does not store, read, or log your messages or attachments.
</Note>
