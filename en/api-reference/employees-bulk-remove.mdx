title: "Remove Employees Bulk"
description: "Previously: Remove Employees Bulk API. Remove multiple employees from your organization in a single request using their email addresses."
---

## Overview

The Remove Employees Bulk API allows you to remove multiple employees from your organization in a single request using their email addresses. This public API is designed for external systems and integrations to manage employee access without requiring admin authentication through the standard JWT flow.

It requires an **Organization Bearer Token** (`auth_token`) for authentication, ensuring only authorized organizations can remove employees from their workspace.

## Important Notes

<Note>
**What happens when you remove employees?**

- Employees are removed from the organization's workspace (`callyzer_user_details`)
- Their organization membership is revoked (`callyzer_user_mappings`)
- The users are **not** deleted from the system entirely - only their association with this specific organization is removed
- The API will process all valid emails and report which ones were successfully removed and which were not found
</Note>

### Partial Success

If some emails are not found in the system, the API will still remove the employees that were found and return both lists in the response:

- **removedEmails:** Successfully removed employees
- **notFoundEmails:** Emails that don't exist in the system

This allows you to handle partial failures gracefully and know exactly which operations succeeded.

---

## Hygiene Practices

<Warning>
- Always use a **valid Organization Auth Token**
- Do not share or expose your token publicly
- Verify email addresses before making API calls to minimize `notFoundEmails`
- Keep your organization credentials secure at all times
- Use this API responsibly - removed employees will lose access to the organization's data
- Consider implementing a confirmation step in your application before calling this API
- Store the API response for audit purposes to track who was removed and when
</Warning>
