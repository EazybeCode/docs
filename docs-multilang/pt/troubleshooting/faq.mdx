**Q1: How does billing work? What is the Eazybe wallet?** 

**A:** All charges for WhatsApp template messages are managed through your Eazybe wallet. Initially, you (organisation) get **₹100 or $1 free **credits in your wallet from Eazybe to get started. For usage beyond that, funds are deducted from your wallet balance. You can easily recharge your wallet from the **Faturamento **section in your dashboard.

**Q2: Can I get the Green Tick on my WhatsApp profile?** 

**A:** Yes. Using an official WABA through Eazybe makes you eligible to apply for Meta's Green Tick verification. This is handled through the Meta Business Manager once your account is active and meets Meta's notability criteria.

**Q3: Why was my Message Template rejected?** 

**A:** Meta has strict policies. Common reasons include promotional content in non-marketing templates, asking for sensitive data, or incorrect formatting. You can create a new template by updating the content and resubmit it.

**Q4: My CSV upload failed. Why?** 

**A:** Please ensure your contact list is a .csv file and contains a column specifically named **"Phone"**. The phone numbers must include the country code, but no + sign (e.g., 91xxxxxxxxxx)

**Q5: Why did my WABA Coexistência account disconnect?**

A: Your account may be disconnected for the following reasons to ensure security and compliance with Meta's guidelines.

- **Switching Mobile Devices:** Your connection may be lost when moving your WhatsApp Business account to a new phone.
- **Parallel App and Web Use:** Using the mobile app and WhatsApp Web at the same time can occasionally cause connection issues.​
- **Inactivity:** The connection can expire if the WhatsApp Business App is not opened for over 14 days.​
- **Scammy Behaviour:** Violating WhatsApp's Business Policy through spam or other prohibited actions will lead to disconnection.
- **Switching Between App Types:** Moving your number between the consumer and Business apps can sever the connection.
