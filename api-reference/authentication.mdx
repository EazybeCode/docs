## API Key Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to Eazybe Workspace
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API**
3. Click **Generate API Key**
4. Copy and store securely

### Using the API Key

Include the API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.eazybe.com/v1/contacts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Security Best Practices

- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use environment variables for storage
- Revoke compromised keys immediately
