description: 'Use WhatsApp Business App and API simultaneously on the same number'

## What is Coexistence?

Coexistence is a unique feature that allows you to use the same WhatsApp number with both:
- **WhatsApp Business App** - For manual, personal conversations
- **WhatsApp Cloud API** - For automated broadcasts and workflows

This means you don't have to choose between the convenience of the mobile app and the power of the API.

<Info>
  Coexistence is exclusive to Eazybe and solves one of the biggest pain points when adopting WhatsApp Business API.

## How It Works

    A[Your Team] --> B[WhatsApp Business App]
    A --> C[Eazybe Chrome Extension]
    A --> D[CRM Workflows]
    
    B --> E[WhatsApp Cloud API]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    
    E --> F[Customer's WhatsApp]
```

**Sync Flow:**
1. Messages sent via Business App sync to the API inbox
2. API-sent messages appear in the Business App
3. Eazybe monitors both channels in Revenue Inbox
4. CRM receives all conversations regardless of source
