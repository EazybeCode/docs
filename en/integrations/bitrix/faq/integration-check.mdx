---

After completing the integration process, you'll want to verify that everything is working correctly.

## Verifying Successful Integration

Once the integration of Bitrix with the EazyBe WhatsApp extension is completed, you will be automatically redirected back to WhatsApp.

<Note>
Look for the **Bitrix icon** in the right sidebar of the EazyBe extension. If you can see the icon, it indicates that the integration has been successfully completed.

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the Bitrix icon after completing the integration:

1. **Refresh the WhatsApp Web page** - Sometimes a simple refresh resolves the issue
2. **Check your browser extensions** - Ensure EazyBe is enabled and running
3. **Re-attempt the integration** - Go through the connection process again
4. **Clear browser cache** - Cached data may interfere with the integration
