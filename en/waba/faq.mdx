    | Reason | Description |

    | **Promotional Content** | Using promotional content in non-marketing template categories |
    | **Sensitive Data Requests** | Asking for sensitive personal or financial data |
    | **Incorrect Formatting** | Template formatting does not meet Meta's guidelines |

    <Warning>
    You can create a new template by updating the content to comply with Meta's policies and resubmit it for approval.

  <Accordion title="My CSV upload failed. Why?">
    CSV upload failures typically occur due to formatting issues. Ensure your contact list meets these requirements:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="File Format">
        The file must be in `.csv` format.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Column Name">
        The file must contain a column specifically named **"Phone"**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Phone Number Format">
        Phone numbers must include the country code but **without** the `+` sign.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **Example Format:**
    ```
    Phone
    91xxxxxxxxxx
    44xxxxxxxxxx
    1xxxxxxxxxx
    ```

  <Accordion title="Why did my WABA Coexistence account disconnect?">
    Your account may disconnect for several reasons related to security and compliance with Meta's guidelines:

    | Reason | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | **Switching Mobile Devices** | Your connection may be lost when moving your WhatsApp Business account to a new phone |
    | **Parallel App and Web Use** | Using the mobile app and WhatsApp Web simultaneously can cause connection issues |
    | **Inactivity** | The connection can expire if the WhatsApp Business App is not opened for over 14 days |
    | **Policy Violations** | Violating WhatsApp's Business Policy through spam or prohibited actions leads to disconnection |
    | **Switching App Types** | Moving your number between the consumer and Business apps can sever the connection |
