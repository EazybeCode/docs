## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between WhatsApp Business App and WABA?">
    **WhatsApp Business App** is the free mobile app for small businesses. **WABA** (WhatsApp Business API) is for medium-large businesses needing broadcasts, automation, and multi-user access.
    
    | Feature | Business App | WABA |
    |---------|--------------|------|
    | Cost | Free | Pay-per-message |
    | Users | 1 | Unlimited |
    | Broadcasts | 256 contacts | Unlimited |
    | Automation | Basic | Advanced |
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need a new phone number for WABA?">
    Not necessarily. With **Coexistence mode**, you can use your existing WhatsApp Business App number while also connecting to the API. Alternatively, you can register a fresh number.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does WABA setup take?">
    The connection process takes **5-10 minutes**. However, message templates require Meta approval which typically takes **24-48 hours**.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is my data secure with Eazybe?">
    Yes. Eazybe does not store your Facebook login credentials. All message data flows through Meta's official API. For Coexistence users, chat backups are stored in your admin's Google Drive.
  </Accordion>

## Templates & Messaging

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do I need message templates?">
    WhatsApp requires pre-approved templates for:
    - Starting conversations with customers (outside 24-hour window)
    - Sending promotional/marketing messages
    - Broadcasts to multiple contacts
    
    Templates prevent spam and ensure quality.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does template approval take?">
    Most templates are approved within **24-48 hours**. Complex templates or those flagged for review may take longer. Marketing templates have stricter review than utility templates.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What is the 24-hour messaging window?">
    When a customer messages you, a **24-hour service window** opens. During this window, you can send any message (not just templates) for free. After 24 hours, you need an approved template to re-engage.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I send images and videos?">
    Yes! Templates support:
    - Images (JPEG, PNG)
    - Videos (MP4)
    - Documents (PDF)
    - Location
    - Interactive buttons
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How does pricing work?">
    WhatsApp charges per **message delivered** based on:
    - Message category (Marketing, Utility, Authentication)
    - Recipient's country
    
    Eazybe charges **no markup** on Meta's rates. You pay only what Meta charges.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I get free messages?">
    Yes! 
    - **New accounts** get ₹100/$1 starter credits
    - **Service conversations** (customer-initiated, within 24 hours) are free
    - **Utility templates** sent within the service window are free
