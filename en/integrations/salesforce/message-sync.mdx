This guide explains how WhatsApp conversations are automatically synchronized with your Salesforce contacts and leads.

## Automatic Synchronization

  WhatsApp conversations with your Salesforce contacts or leads are automatically synced every **3 minutes**.

The last synced date and time displays in the EazyBe extension. You can verify the sync completion by clicking the icon to access the contact's Salesforce page.

## Initial Integration

When you first integrate Salesforce with EazyBe, the system automatically provides backup data spanning the **past 3 days**. This ensures you have recent conversation history available immediately.
