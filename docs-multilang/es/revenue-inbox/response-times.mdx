## Why Response Time Matters

Fast response times lead to:
- **Higher conversion rates** - Leads go cold quickly
- **Better customer satisfaction** - Customers expect quick replies
- **Competitive advantage** - Beat competitors to the response
- **Trust building** - Shows you value their time

## Response Time Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **First Response Time** | Time from customer message to first reply | < 5 minutes (ideal) |
| **Average Response Time** | Mean time across all replies | < 30 minutes |
| **SLA Compliance** | % of chats responded within target | > 90% |
| **Resolution Time** | Time from first message to issue resolved | < 24 hours |
