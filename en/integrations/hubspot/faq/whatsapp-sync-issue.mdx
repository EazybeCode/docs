## 4. Label Sync Permissions

If your conversations aren't backing up even though labels are being created, check your label sync settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Label Settings">
    Navigate to your label settings in the Eazybe extension.

    ![Label Settings](/images/1185301122.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Sync Status">
    Ensure the label is set to **Sync** and not **Don't Sync**.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Labels set to "Don't Sync" will not back up conversations to HubSpot. Change them to "Sync" to enable backup.
</Tip>
