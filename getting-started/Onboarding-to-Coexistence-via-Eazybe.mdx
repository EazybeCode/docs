## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Integration Failed" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Common Causes:**
    - WhatsApp app version is outdated (below 2.24.17)
    - Number has been inactive for extended period
    - Meta restrictions on the account
    - No Facebook Page admin access

    **Solution:**
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Verify App Version">
        Update WhatsApp Business App to version 2.24.17 or newer
      </Step>
      <Step title="Check Account Status">
        Ensure no Meta restrictions or policy violations exist
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify Admin Access">
        Confirm you have admin access to your Facebook Business Page
      </Step>
      <Step title="Use Alternative Number">
        If issues persist, try a different number with active WhatsApp Business usage and no past violations
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Chat History Did Not Import" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **If chat import fails:**

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open WhatsApp Business App">
        Navigate to the app on your phone
      </Step>
      <Step title="Access Business Tools">
        Go to: Settings → Business Tools → WhatsApp Business Platform
      </Step>
      <Step title="Disconnect">
        Tap **Disconnect** to unlink the current connection
      </Step>
      <Step title="Restart Onboarding">
        Begin the Coexistence onboarding process again
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Warning>
    If you manually skipped history import during initial setup and selected the wrong option, old chats may not be recoverable. A full disconnect and reconnect is required.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Number Has Meta Restrictions" icon="ban">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Coexistence onboarding fails instantly
    - QR code doesn't complete verification
    - No "Connect to Business Platform" message appears in app

    **Solution:**
    Use a different number that has:
    - Zero policy violations
    - Frequent legitimate WhatsApp Business activity
    - No previous restrictions or bans

    <Note>
    Meta restrictions cannot be bypassed. A clean number is required for successful Coexistence setup.
