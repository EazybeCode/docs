If you have many contacts connected with HubSpot but want to control which contacts’ chats get synced, you can manage sync settings for specific contacts using labels in EazyBe. Here’s how:


- **Create a Shared Label:**


Ensure that you have created a shared label within the EazyBe WhatsApp extension.


- Add the contacts for whom you **do not** want chat backups to be synced with HubSpot under that label.


- **Access Backup and Sync Settings:**


Click on the **Backup and Sync icon** in the right sidebar of the WhatsApp extension.

- In the window that appears, click on the **HubSpot button**.


- **Disable Sync for Specific Contacts:**


Locate the label containing the contacts you don’t want to sync.


- Click on the **Don’t Sync button** beside the label. This will stop the chats from being synced for the contacts in that label on HubSpot.

To enable sync again, click the **Sync button**.
