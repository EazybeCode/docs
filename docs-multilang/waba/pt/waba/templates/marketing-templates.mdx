## What Are Marketing Templates?

Marketing templates are used for **promotional messages** designed to:
- Drive sales and conversions
- Announce new products or features
- Re-engage inactive customers
- Share offers and discounts

<Warning>
Marketing templates have the **highest cost** per message and require explicit opt-in from recipients.

## Approval Tips for Marketing

Marketing templates undergo stricter review. To improve approval chances:

1. **Be honest** – Don't make exaggerated claims
2. **Stay compliant** – Avoid restricted products
3. **Include opt-out** – "Reply STOP to unsubscribe"
4. **Use buttons for URLs** – Don't embed links in body text
5. **Match content to category** – Don't submit promotional content as "Utility"
