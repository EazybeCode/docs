description: 'Send targeted WhatsApp campaigns to CRM contact lists'
---

## Overview

Send personalized WhatsApp campaigns to thousands of contacts using your CRM lists. This playbook covers everything from list creation to campaign analytics.

<Info>
**Setup Time**: 30 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Requires**: WhatsApp Business API (WABA)
</Info>

## The Problem

Email campaigns have 20% open rates. Your messages get lost in spam. Meanwhile, WhatsApp has:
- 98% open rate
- 45-60% response rate
- Messages read within minutes

But sending bulk WhatsApp manually is impossible.

## The Solution

Broadcast campaigns sent directly from your CRM:
