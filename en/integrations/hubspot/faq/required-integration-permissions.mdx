## What Permissions Are Required for the Integration?

During the HubSpot integration setup, necessary permissions will be requested to ensure smooth operation of the Eazybe WhatsApp Chrome Extension.

<Warning>
Your **super-admin** must grant two critical permissions for the integration to work properly:
- **File** permission
- **Apps Marketplace** permission
</Warning>

These permissions are essential for smooth syncing and backup of your WhatsApp chats using the Eazybe WhatsApp Chrome Extension.
