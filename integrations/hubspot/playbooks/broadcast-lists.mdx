## The Problem

You have segmented lists in HubSpot:
- Leads from last month
- Customers in specific region
- Contacts who attended webinar

But no easy way to reach them on WhatsApp at scale.

## The Solution

Send targeted WhatsApp campaigns directly from HubSpot lists.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Part 1: Prepare Your HubSpot List

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or Select List">
    Go to **Contacts** → **Lists** → **Create list** (or select existing)

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set List Criteria">
    Example: Re-engagement campaign
    
    ```
    Last activity date is more than 30 days ago
    AND Lifecycle stage is any of: Lead, MQL
    AND Phone number is known
    AND WhatsApp opt-in is Yes (if you track this)
    ```

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Phone Numbers">
    Check that contacts have valid phone numbers:
    - Include country code
    - E.164 format preferred (+919876543210)
    
    **Pro tip**: Add filter `Phone number contains +` to catch formatted numbers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Note List Size">
    Check contact count. Keep in mind:
    - New WABA numbers have daily limits (start ~250/day)
    - Established numbers can send 1,000+ per day
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Part 2: Create Approved Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design Campaign Template">
    In Eazybe, create template for your campaign:
    
    **Example: Re-engagement**
    ```
    Hi {{1}}! 👋
    
    It's been a while since we connected. We've added some exciting new features at {{2}} that I think you'd find valuable.
    
    Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call to catch up?
    
    Reply YES and I'll send over some times, or STOP to opt out.
    ```

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit and Wait for Approval">
    Marketing templates take 24-48 hours for Meta review.

  <img src="/images/hubspot/campaign-analytics.png" alt="Campaign analytics" />
</Frame>

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Delivered | > 95% | Failed = invalid numbers |
| Read | > 80% | WhatsApp has high open rates |
| Replied | > 15% | Depends on offer/message |
| Opted Out | < 2% | High = message not relevant |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start small">
    Test with 50-100 contacts first. Check delivery and response before scaling.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Segment thoughtfully">
    Generic blasts perform worse. The more targeted your list, the better results.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Time it right">
    Best times: 10am-12pm and 3pm-5pm local time. Avoid weekends for B2B.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Prepare for responses">
    Broadcasts generate replies. Have team ready to handle incoming messages.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include opt-out">
    Always include "Reply STOP to opt out" for compliance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Low delivery rate?">
    - Invalid phone numbers in list
    - Numbers not on WhatsApp
    - WABA quality rating dropped
    - Daily limit reached
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't import HubSpot list?">
    - Check Eazybe-HubSpot connection
    - Verify you have list read permissions in HubSpot
    - Try reconnecting HubSpot integration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Variables showing blank?">
    Some contacts missing the property. Either:
    - Clean list to only include contacts with required properties
    - Use default/fallback values in template
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
