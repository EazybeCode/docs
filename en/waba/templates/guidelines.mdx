## Overview

Understanding Meta's template approval process is essential for successful WhatsApp Business API campaigns. This guide covers approval timelines, category requirements, and best practices to ensure your templates are approved quickly.

<Note>
Meta uses automated AI combined with human review. Official guidance indicates approvals may take up to **24 hours**, though most process faster.
</Note>

## Approval Timeframes

| Scenario | Estimated Time | Details |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Standard Approval** | 1–5 Minutes | Most well-structured templates are approved almost instantly by Meta's automated systems. |
| **Complex / Flagged** | 1–24 Hours | If the AI detects ambiguous content or potential policy violations, the template is routed for human review. |
| **Re-Submission** | Up to 24 Hours | Reappealing a rejected template or category change often requires manual verification. |

<Tip>
Plan your campaigns at least **24 hours in advance** to account for potential review delays.
</Tip>

## Requirements for Successful Approval

### Content & Formatting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provide Variable Samples">
    Always provide samples for your variables (e.g., `{{1}}` = "John"). Meta rejects templates with unclear variables.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Grammar & Spelling">
    Templates with spelling errors or poor grammar are automatically rejected as "low quality."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Avoid Link Shorteners">
    Do not use generic link shorteners (like bit.ly) in the body text—they obscure the destination URL and trigger security flags. Use the specific **Button** feature for links instead.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Policy Compliance

<Warning>
**No Mixed Categories:** Templates mixing transactional and promotional content will be rejected.
</Warning>

**Example of Rejected Mixed Content:**
```
Your order #123 is confirmed. Check out our new arrivals!
```
This would be rejected as a Utility template because it contains promotional content.

**Restricted Content to Avoid:**
- Requesting sensitive identifiers (credit card numbers, full ID numbers)
- Threatening language (e.g., "Pay now or legal action will be taken")

<Info>
**Category Auto-Correction:** If Meta's system detects that your "Utility" template is actually "Marketing," they will auto-update the category. You have **60 days** to appeal this change if you disagree.
</Info>

## Understanding Template Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pending** | The template is currently under review by Meta. |
| **Approved** | The template is approved and ready to send. |
| **Rejected** | The template failed review. Check the "Reason" provided in the dashboard (e.g., "Promotional content in Utility"). |
| **Paused** | The template has been flagged for low quality (high block rates from users). You cannot send it until the quality score improves. |
