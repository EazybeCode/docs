## Data Storage Architecture

### Where Your Data Lives

| Data Type | Storage Location | Eazybe Access |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| WhatsApp Messages | Your Google Drive | ❌ No access |
| CRM Data | Your CRM (HubSpot, Zoho, etc.) | ❌ No access |
| Attachments | Your Google Drive / CRM | ❌ No access |
| User Account Info | Eazybe servers (encrypted) | ✅ Required |
| Usage Analytics | Eazybe servers (anonymized) | ✅ Anonymized |

<Warning>
  **Important**: Eazybe does NOT store your WhatsApp message content on our servers. All chat data is stored in YOUR Google Drive and connected CRM.
</Warning>

### How Chat Backup Works

    A[WhatsApp Message] --> B[Eazybe Extension]

    B -.->|No storage| E[Eazybe Servers]
```

1. Message sent/received on WhatsApp
2. Eazybe extension processes locally
3. Backup goes to YOUR Google Drive (admin's account)
4. Sync goes to YOUR connected CRM
