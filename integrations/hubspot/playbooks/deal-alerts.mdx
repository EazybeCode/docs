title: 'Deal Stage Alerts'
description: 'Get WhatsApp notifications when deals move through pipeline'
---

<Info>
**Setup Time**: 15 minutes | **Difficulty**: Medium | **HubSpot Plan**: Professional+  
**Requires**: WABA (for external alerts) or works without for internal notifications
</Info>

## The Problem

Deals move through your pipeline, but:
- Customers don't know their status
- Reps forget to update clients
- Manual status updates are inconsistent

## The Solution

Automatic WhatsApp notifications when deals change stage.

## Use Cases

| Deal Stage Change | WhatsApp Alert |
|-------------------|----------------|
| New → Qualified | "Thanks for your interest! A rep will reach out shortly." |
| Qualified → Demo Scheduled | "Your demo is confirmed for {{date}}" |
| Demo → Proposal | "Proposal sent! Let me know if you have questions." |
| Proposal → Negotiation | "Thanks for your feedback. Let's discuss the details." |
| Negotiation → Won | "Welcome aboard! 🎉 Here's what happens next..." |
| Any → Lost | "Sorry we couldn't work together this time. Door's always open!" |

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Templates for Each Stage">
    Create approved templates for each notification:
    
    **Template: `deal_qualified`**
    ```
    Hi {{1}}! Thanks for your interest in {{2}}. 
    
    {{3}} from our team will reach out within 24 hours to learn more about your needs.
    
    In the meantime, any questions?
    ```

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Deal-Based Workflow">
    In HubSpot: **Automation** → **Workflows** → **Create** → **Deal-based**
    
    <Frame>

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Stage Change Trigger">
    Enrollment trigger:
    ```
    When: Deal stage is any of [Qualified]
    AND: Deal stage was updated in the last 1 day
    ```

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get Associated Contact">
    Add action: **Get associated contact**
    
    This pulls the contact linked to the deal so we can message them.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Eazybe WhatsApp Action">
    Add **Eazybe: Send WhatsApp** action
    
    Map variables from both Deal and Contact:
    
    | Variable | Source |
    |----------|--------|
    | {1} | Contact: First name |
    | {2} | Deal: Deal name |
    | {3} | Deal: Owner name |
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/hubspot/deal-alert-action.png" alt="Configure deal alert" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Repeat for Other Stages">
    Create separate workflows for each stage change you want to notify on.
    
    Or use branching within one workflow:
    
    ```
    If deal stage = Qualified → Send qualified template
    If deal stage = Proposal → Send proposal template
    If deal stage = Won → Send won template
    ```
  </Step>

## Internal Alerts (No WABA Needed)

Want to notify your **team** instead of customers? Use internal WhatsApp alerts:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Task Creation Instead">
    Instead of Eazybe action, create a HubSpot task:
    
    - **Task title**: "Send WhatsApp update to {contact.name}"
    - **Assigned to**: Deal owner
    - **Due**: Immediately
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rep Gets Task Notification">
    Rep receives task notification and sends WhatsApp manually using Eazybe quick replies.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Don't notify on every stage">
    Pick the stages that matter most to customers. Too many messages = annoyed customers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Personalize by deal type">
    Different products/services might need different messaging. Use HubSpot branching.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include next steps">
    Don't just say "your deal moved." Tell them what happens next.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Message going to wrong contact?">
    Deal might have multiple associated contacts. Add filter to get primary contact only.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No contact associated?">
    Some deals don't have contacts linked. Add a branch to check before sending.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
