## Overview

To ensure a smooth integration with Eazybe, you must enable the necessary permissions for custom objects in your Zoho CRM account. These permissions allow Eazybe to sync custom objects correctly between Zoho CRM and your workspace.

## Steps to Enable Custom Object Permissions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log Into Zoho CRM">
    Sign in to your Zoho CRM account using administrator credentials. You need admin access to modify permission settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Permissions Settings">
    Navigate to the **Permissions** or **Customization** settings in your Zoho CRM dashboard.

    <Note>
      A dedicated "Custom Object" section may not be visible in the current interface. Look for permission settings within the general customization area.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Required Permissions">
    Within the permissions area, ensure the following permissions are enabled:

    - **Create Custom Objects** - Allows creating new custom objects
    - **Edit Custom Objects** - Allows modifying existing custom objects
    - **Update Custom Objects** - Allows updating custom object records
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save** to confirm your settings and enable proper Eazybe integration management.
  </Step>
