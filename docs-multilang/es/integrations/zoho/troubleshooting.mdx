Your WhatsApp conversations aren't syncing with ZOHO? You're moving your conversations forward, but the backup isn't getting stored on ZOHO. Worried about losing your chats? Don't worry! This troubleshooting guide will help you check that everything is set up correctly for syncing.

### Grant Access

EazyBe asks for specific permissions when integrating with ZOHO. Ensure that these permissions are granted, as they are crucial for storing WhatsApp conversations via the EazyBe WhatsApp Extension. Make sure you are the part of an organisation with access to **CRM permissions**. If you are not a part of an organisation, you'll need to join one or create a new organisation to enable smooth syncing of **WhatsApp Chats in ZOHO**.
